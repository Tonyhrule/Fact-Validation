[{"passage":"We investigated the role of surgical ablation targeting the autonomous nervous system during a Cox-Maze IV procedure in the maintenance of sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up.\nThe patient population consisted of 519 subjects with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing radiofrequency Maze IV during open heart surgery between January 2006 and July 2013 at three institutions without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation off-antiarrhythmic drugs was the primary outcome. Predictors of AF recurrence were evaluated by means of competing risk regression. Median follow-up was 36.7 months.\nThe percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) off-antiarrhythmic drugs did not differ between groups (Group 1-75.5%, Group 2-67.8%, p = 0.08). Duration of AF \u2265 38 months (p = 0.01), left atrial diameter \u2265 54 mm (0.001), left atrial area \u2265 33 cm(2) (p = 0.005), absence of connecting lesions (p= 0.04), and absence of right atrial ablation (p<0.001) were independently associated with high incidence of AF recurrence. In contrast the absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor (p = 0.12)."},{"passage":"Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis.\nHistological examination showed that perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT."},{"passage":"Tuberculosis has increased in parallel with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and the growing incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially with intestinal involvement, reflects this trend. However, the duration of anti-tuberculous therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis.AIM: To compare the efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms of response and recurrence rates.\nForty patients with tuberculous enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and\/or acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy.\nComplete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group."},{"passage":"Tethering of the spinal cord is thought to increase the chance of neurological injury when scoliosis correction is undertaken. All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction.\nSeventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period.\nThe average age of the patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1\/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction. All patients underwent neuromonitoring of their upper extremities, and some underwent lower extremity monitoring as well. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness\/sensory loss. One patient had transient lower extremity weakness, which returned to baseline within 1 month of surgery."},{"passage":"This article examines the hypothesis that the six U.S. states with the highest rates of road traffic deaths (group 1 states) also had above-average rates of other forms of injury such as falling, poisoning, drowning, fire, suffocation, homicide, and suicide, and also for the retail trade and construction industries. The converse, second hypothesis, for the six states with the lowest rates of road traffic deaths (group 2 states) is also examined.\nData for these 12 states for the period 1983 to 1995 included nine categories of unintentional and four categories of intentional injury.

The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).\nFrom January 2006 to December 2008, a retrospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients with ESCC was conducted. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for preoperative platelet count. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters.\nA ROC curve for survival prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for platelet count, which was 205 (\u00d7 10(9)\/L). Patients with platelet count \u2264 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count>205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P<0.001). The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count \u2264 205 or>205 were similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 5-year survival of patients with platelet count \u2264 205 was better than that of patients with a platelet count>205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 %, P = 0.004).

In addition, the prevalence of DM is more than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal examination can be used for determining glucose levels.\nObservational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and subsequent readings were recorded.\nThe patient's blood glucose values ranged from 74 to 256 mg\/dl.

Our aim was to investigate the value of preoperative Hb levels to predict transfusion and thereby tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics.\nAll consecutive patients who undergone primary TKA in our center over 2\u00a0years, and received tranexamic acid intraoperatively, were reviewed. The adjusted association between preoperative Hb levels and transfusion was assessed by multivariate logistic regression, and the estimated probability of transfusion for individual patients was derived from the logistic model.\nOut of the 784 patients who meet the inclusion criteria, risk of transfusion was associated with poorer performance status, as measured by the America Association of Anestesiology (ASA) score III\/IV (OR: 3\u00b73, P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001) and lower preoperative Hb level (OR 3\u00b78 for each g\/dl below 13\u00a0g\/dl; P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001).

These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical pediatric housestaff.\nOur neonatal ICU has either a resident or an intern on-call by himself\/herself at night, affording us a natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood gases per call night at our institution.

Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy.\nThe study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +\/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning.\nBile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31\/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33\/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5\/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group.

The fractured bones were examined with ultrasound, X-ray, and CT, which served as the gold standard.\n162 of 248 bones were fractured. 130 fractures were identified using ultrasound, and 148 using X-ray. There were some advantages of X-ray over ultrasound in the detection of fracture type (80 correct results using X-ray, 66 correct results using ultrasound).

Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center.\nWe retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test.\nMain indications for pancreatic surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23\/42 (55%) patients with coverage vs. 16\/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection margins in 7\/32 (22%) vs. 4\/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%.

Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown.\nAll women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [\u22652 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed.\nOf 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043)."},{"passage":"To evaluate the effect of an antismoking advertisement on young people's perceptions of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke.SUBJECTS\/\n3091 cinema patrons aged 12-24 years in three Australian states; 18.6% of the sample (n = 575) were current smokers.DESIGN\/\nQuasi-experimental study of patrons, surveyed after having viewed a movie.

Eligible women had at least 1 prior sonographic examination beyond 18 weeks' gestation with a complete and normal fetal anatomic assessment and at least 1 follow-up sonogram. Full fetal anatomic surveys were performed on all follow-up sonograms regardless of the indication. Neonatal charts were reviewed for those patients whose follow-up sonograms revealed unanticipated fetal anomalies. Neonatal intervention was defined as surgical or medical therapy or arranged subspecialty follow-up specifically for the suspected fetal anomaly.\nOf a total of 4269 sonographic examinations performed, 437 (10.2%) were follow-up studies. Of these, 101 (23.1%) were excluded because the initial sonogram revealed a suspected fetal anomaly, and 42 (9.8%) were excluded for other reasons. Of the remaining 294 women, 21 (7.1%) had an unanticipated fetal anomaly, most often renal pyelectasis. Compared with follow-up sonography for other reasons, repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation yielded a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies: 15 (12.3%) of 122 versus 6 (3.5%) of 172 (P = .01).

The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.\nTwenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.\nQualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one.

Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working.\nData for this study were gathered during the winter of 2007\/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted.\nSEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes by the use of process-oriented performance measures. However, the implementation of care programmes is not (yet) accompanied by a change in focus from function (the delivery of independent care activities) to process (the delivery of care activities as being connected to a chain of interdependent care activities)."},{"passage":"Dyschesia can be provoked by inappropriate defecation movements.

The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been studied before.\nFor the random sample of men and women from the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality.\nThe results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol\/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women.

Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02)."},{"passage":"The use of the private sector for health care is increasing, but it is unclear whether this will reduce demand on the NHS.

The mucin 1 (MUC1) heterodimeric protein is aberrantly overexpressed in NSCLC cells and confers a poor prognosis; however, the functional involvement of MUC1 in mutant EGFR signaling is not known.\nTargeting the oncogenic MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) in NSCLC cells harboring mutant EGFR was studied for effects on signaling, growth, clonogenic survival, and tumorigenicity.\nStable silencing of MUC1-C in H1975\/EGFR(L858R\/T790M) cells resulted in downregulation of AKT signaling and inhibition of growth, colony formation, and tumorigenicity. Similar findings were obtained when MUC1-C was silenced in gefitinib-resistant PC9GR cells expressing EGFR(delE746_A750\/T790M). The results further show that expression of a MUC1-C(CQC \u2192 AQA) mutant, which blocks MUC1-C homodimerization, suppresses EGFR(T790M), AKT and MEK \u2192 ERK activation, colony formation, and tumorigenicity. In concert with these results, treatment of H1975 and PC9GR cells with GO-203, a cell-penetrating peptide that blocks MUC1-C homodimerization, resulted in inhibition of EGFR, AKT, and MEK \u2192 ERK signaling and in loss of survival. Combination studies of GO-203 and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of EGFR, further demonstrate that these agents are synergistic in inhibiting growth of NSCLC cells harboring the activating EGFR(T790M) or EGFR(delE746-A750) mutants."},{"passage":"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is known to reduce fasting blood glucose in individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was subjected to gene-expression microarray analysis.\nThe patients were stratified into four subgroups (subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2) by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. By use of principle-components analysis (PCA), the patients were divided into subtypes A and B on the basis of component 1 and into subtypes 1 and 2 on the basis of component 2. Subtype A was significantly enriched among patients without the KRAS mutation and with an earlier clinical stage at diagnosis. With regard to anti-EGFR therapy, progression-free survival (PFS) was better for patients in subtype A without the KRAS mutation than for those with the KRAS mutation (P = 0.047).

Serum 25(OH) vitamin-D was estimated, and levels <20 ng ml(-1) were considered as VDD. Risk factors and clinical features of VDD were assessed. Gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) was assessed by ultrasound after a standard fatty meal, and <40 % was defined as stasis. Statistical analysis was performed to assess relationship of GB stasis and vitamin-D levels and identify factors associated with VDD.\nMedian serum vitamin-D in 304 women was 7.9 ng ml(-1) (IQR 5.7, 12).

While the effects on the mutation in the DNA replication-related element (DRE) in cultured cells have been studied extensively, the consequences of elevating wild-type DREF activity in developing tissues have hitherto remained unclear.\nWe over-expressed DREF in the wing imaginal disc using a GAL4-UAS targeted expression system in Drosophila. Over-expression of DREF induced a notching wing phenotype, which was associated with ectopic apoptosis. A half reduction of the reaper, head involution defective and grim gene dose suppressed this DREF-induced notching wing phenotype. Furthermore, this was also the case with co-expression of baculovirus P35, a caspase inhibitor. In addition, over-expression of the 32 kDa boundary element-associated factor (BEAF-32), thought to compete against DREF for common binding sites in genomic regions, rescued the DREF-induced notching wing phenotype, while a half reduction of the genomic region, including the BEAF-32 gene, exerted enhancing effects.

Even today, activities around the olive tree constitute major engagements of several people in the countryside of both sides of the Mediterranean basin. The olive fly is, beyond doubt, the most destructive pest of cultivated olives. The female fly leaves its eggs in the olive fruit. Upon emergence, the larvae feed on the olive sap, thus destroying the fruit. If untreated, practically all olives get infected. The use of chemical insecticides constitutes the principal olive fly control approach. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), an environmentally friendly alternative control method, had been tried in pilot field applications in the 1970's, albeit with no practical success. This was mainly attributed to the low, non-antagonistic quality of the mixed-sex released insects. Many years of experience from successful SIT applications in related species, primarily the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, demonstrated that efficient SIT protocols require the availability of fundamental genetic and molecular information.\nAmong the primary systems whose understanding can contribute towards novel SIT approaches (or its recently developed alternative RIDL: Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal) is the reproductive, since the ability to manipulate the reproductive system would directly affect the insect's fertility. In addition, the analysis of early embryonic promoters and apoptotic genes would provide tools that confer dominant early-embryonic lethality during mass-rearing. Here we report the identification of several genes involved in these systems through whole transcriptome analysis of female accessory glands (FAGs) and spermathecae, as well as male testes. Indeed, analysis of differentially expressed genes in these tissues revealed higher metabolic activity in testes than in FAGs\/spermathecae. Furthermore, at least five olfactory-related genes were shown to be differentially expressed in the female and male reproductive systems analyzed.

For this IRB-approved study, BPE and fibroglandular tissue FGT were retrospectively assessed by two experienced radiologists according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between BPE, FGT, age and final diagnosis of breast cancer. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis, considering covariate colinearities, was performed, using final diagnosis as the target variable and BPE, FGT and age as covariates.\nAge showed a moderate negative correlation with FGT (r = -0.43, p<0.001) and a weak negative correlation with BPE (r = -0.28, p<0.001). FGT and BPE correlated moderately (r = 0.35, p<0.001). Final diagnosis of breast cancer displayed very weak negative correlations with FGT (r = -0.09, p = 0.046) and BPE (r = -0.156, p<0.001) and weak positive correlation with age (r = 0.353, p<0.001).

Here we investigated sevoflurane- and propofol-induced postconditioning and their relationship with MPTP.\nIsolated perfused rat hearts were exposed to 40 min of ischemia followed by 1 h of reperfusion. During the first 15 min of reperfusion, hearts were treated with either control buffer (CTRL group) or buffer containing 20 micromol\/L atractyloside (ATR group), 3% (v\/v) sevoflurane (SPC group), 50 micromol\/L propofol (PPC group), or the combination of atractyloside with respective anesthetics (SPC+ATR and PPC+ATR groups). Infarct size was determined by dividing the total necrotic area of the left ventricle by the total left ventricular slice area (percent necrotic area).\nHearts treated with sevoflurane or propofol showed significantly better recovery of coronary flow, end-diastolic pressures, left ventricular developed pressure and derivatives compared with controls. Sevoflurane resulted in more protective alteration of hemodynamics at most time point of reperfusion than propofol. These improvements were paralleled with the reduction of lactate dehydrogenase release and the decrease of infarct size (SPC vs CTRL: (17.48+\/-2.70)% vs (48.47+\/-6.03)%, P<0.05; PPC vs CTRL: (35.60+\/-2.10)% vs (48.47+\/-6.03)%, P<0.05).

Thus, by day 8 after injection, anti-H7(a) T cells in the tumor had undergone more cell divisions than those in the spleen. These data strongly suggest that anti-H7(a) T cells proliferate preferentially and extensively in the tumors. We also found that two host factors regulated long-term persistence of anti-H7(a) memory T cells: thymic function and expression of H7(a) by host cells. On day 100, anti-H7(a) memory T cells were abundant in euthymic H7(a)-negative (B10.H7(b)) mice, present in low numbers in thymectomized H7(a)-positive (B10) hosts, and undetectable in euthymic H7(a)-positive recipients."},{"passage":"The critical issue related to breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is that cosmetic outcomes deteriorate with long-term follow-up.

Blood transfusion is the commonest form of alloantigen pretreatment currently used in clinical practice. However, for recipients of organs from cadaver donors, it is not possible to predict the identity of the organ donor in advance. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that all the alloantigens expressed by a cadaver organ donor will be represented in the alloantigen pretreatment inoculum. We have previously shown that it is not necessary to expose the recipient to the full complement of donor alloantigens to induce long-term survival of a subsequent cardiac allograft. Here, we investigated the in vivo mechanism responsible for this phenomena.\nUnresponsiveness to the mouse MHC class I molecule Kb was induced in CBA.Ca (H2k) recipients by administration of bone marrow cells from transgenic CBA mice, CBK (H2k + Kb) before transplantation of fully allogeneic and F1 vascularized cardiac allografts.\nPretreatment with CBK bone marrow cells resulted in the long-term survival of all cardiac allografts expressing H2-Kb. For example, C57BL\/10 (H2b) and (CBKxBALB\/c) F1 (H2k,d + Kb) cardiac allografts were accepted by recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells before transplantation. In contrast, allografts that did not express Kb, such as BALB\/c (H2d) or (CBAxBALB\/c) F1 (H2k,d), were rejected acutely, with a median survival time (MST) of 7 and 6 days, respectively, in recipients treated with CBK bone marrow cells. Furthermore, when recipients pretreated with CBK bone marrow cells were grafted with a BALB\/c heart and a CBK heart simultaneously, the BALB\/c hearts were rejected (MST=10 days), whereas the CBK hearts were accepted. By contrast, in the maintenance phase (i.e., after transplantation), recipients with long-term surviving (CBKxBALB\/c) F1 hearts (> 100 days) were found to accept BALB\/c hearts indefinitely, whereas fourth-party B10.S (H2s) grafts were rejected (MST=7.5 days). This indicated that the allografts bearing Kb could tolerize recipients to other alloantigens expressed by the transplanted heart."},{"passage":"Collagens are important components of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

With immunohistochemistry (IHC), Type I and Type III collagen proteins were analyzed and, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), collagen mRNA expression was analyzed. Collagen synthesis and degradation was studied by measuring N-terminal pro-peptide for Type I collagen (PINP), N-terminal pro-peptide for Type III collagen (PIIINP) and carboxyterminal telopeptide for Type I collagen (ICTP) in plasma. Collagen composition was measured using the hydroxyproline\/Sircol assay.\nThe ECM volume increased in the first 200 days after LVAD implantation. At between 200 and 400 days the ECM volume decreased, but remained higher than pre-LVAD. After 400 days the ECM volume was smaller than the pre-LVAD volume. IHC did not show a significant difference pre- and post-LVAD for collagen composition.

However, evidence is lacking to determine the relevance of TEs in plant asexual genome evolution and their associated effects. Here, we characterize the repetitive fraction of the genome of the common dandelion, Taraxacum officinale and compare it between five accessions from the same apomictic lineage. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the extent of within-lineage divergence attributed to TE content and activity. We examined the repetitive genomic contribution, diversity, transcription and methylation changes to characterize accession-specific TEs.\nUsing low-coverage genomic sequencing, we report a highly heterogeneous TE compartment in the triploid apomict T. officinale representing up to 38.6\u00a0% of the homoploid genome. The repetitive compartment is dominated by LTR retrotransposon families accompanied by few non-LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons. Up to half of the repeat clusters are biased towards very high read identity, indicating recent and potentially ongoing activity of these TE families. Interestingly, the five accessions are divided into two main clades based on their TE composition. Clade 2 is more dynamic than clade 1 with higher abundance of Gypsy Chromovirus sequences and transposons. Furthermore, a few low-abundant genomic TE clusters exhibit high level of transcription in two of the accessions analysed.

We thus studied the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on promoting lymphangiogenesis and improving secondary lymphedema.\nA rabbit ear model of lymphedema was created by disruption of lymphatic vessels. Two weeks after surgery, the lymphedematous ear was treated with or without low-energy shock waves (0.09 mJ\/mm(2), 200 shots), three times per week for 4 weeks.\nWestern blot analysis showed that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C (1.23-fold, P < .05) and VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3; 1.53-fold, P < .05) was significantly increased in the ears treated with shock wave than in the untreated lymphedematous ears. Compared with the control group, shock wave treatment led to a significant decrease in the thickness of lymphedematous ears (3.80 +\/- 0.25 mm vs 4.54 +\/- 0.18 mm, P < .05).

Maternal organs were cultured to assess the spread of the infection. Six fetal units (placenta, amniotic fluid, membranes, and fetus) per dam were cultured; additional fetal units were examined by histopathology. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on placentas.\nColonization rates were dependent on the strain of P gingivalis used and the infection dose. At an infection dose of 10(9) CFU\/dam, P gingivalis W83, ATCC 33277, or A7436 was detected in 33%, 83%, or 100% of placentas, respectively.

However, how Notch signaling regulates the EMT process and invasion in breast cancer remains largely unknown.\nThe impact of Notch1 silencing by specific shRNAs on the EMT and invasion of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells as well as xenografts was tested by western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, transwell, and immunohistochemistry assays. The effect of Slug silencing or upregulation on the EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells was analyzed, and the effect of Notch1 signaling on Slug expression was determined by the luciferase reporter assay.\nThe Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and Jagged1 were expressed in breast cancer cells. Notch1 silencing reversed the spontaneous EMT process and inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and the growth of xenograft breast cancers. The expression of N1ICD was upregulated significantly by Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling activation. Moreover, Jagged1-mediated Notch signaling promoted the EMT process, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells, which were abrogated by Notch silencing. Furthermore, the N1ICD positively regulated the Slug expression by inducing Slug promoter activation. Importantly, the knockdown of Slug weakened the invasion ability of breast cancer cells and reversed the Jagged1-induced EMT process with significantly decreased expression of vimentin and increased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, Slug overexpression restored the Notch1 knockdown-suppressed EMT process."},{"passage":"To determine the generalizability of the predictions for 90-day mortality generated by Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and the serum sodium augmented MELD (MELDNa) to Atlantic Canadian adults with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation (LT).\nThe predictive accuracy of the MELD and the MELDNa was evaluated by measurement of the discrimination and calibration of the respective models' estimates for the occurrence of 90-day mortality in a consecutive cohort of LT candidates accrued over a five-year period. Accuracy of discrimination was measured by the area under the ROC curves. Calibration accuracy was evaluated by comparing the observed and model-estimated incidences of 90-day wait-list failure for the total cohort and within quantiles of risk.\nThe area under the ROC curve for the MELD was 0.887 (95% CI 0.705 to 0.978) - consistent with very good accuracy of discrimination. The area under the ROC curve for the MELDNa was 0.848 (95% CI 0.681 to 0.965). The observed incidence of 90-day wait-list mortality in the validation cohort was 7.9%, which was not significantly different from the MELD estimate of 6.6% (95% CI 4.9% to 8.4%; P=0.177) or the MELDNa estimate of 5.8% (95% CI 3.5% to 8.0%; P=0.065).

Nephroureterectomy was carried out either by endoscopic or extravesical bladder cuff excision. The oncological outcome between these two procedures was analyzed in patients with different tumor locations.\nThe average age of the patients was 66.41 \u00b1 10.52 years, and the median follow-up duration was 40.65 \u00b1 23.84 months. For upper urinary tract urothelial cancer management, extravesical bladder cuff excision was carried out in 240 patients, whereas the endoscopic method was carried out in 156 patients. Previous bladder cancer is still the most independent predictor for bladder recurrence (P < 0.001). In addition, endoscopic bladder cuff management for low ureteral tumor was also independently associated with more bladder tumor recurrence (P = 0.017). Non-organ confined pathological stage still independently predicted metastasis (P < 0.001) and cancer-specific death (P < 0.001)."},{"passage":"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and an increased frequency in deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes some of the subunits of the ETC, have been reported in the substantia nigra of PD brains. The identification of mutations in the PINK1 gene, which cause an autosomal recessive form of PD, has supported mitochondrial involvement in PD. The PINK1 protein is a serine\/threonine kinase localized in mitochondria and the cytosol. Its precise function is unknown, but it is involved in neuroprotection against a variety of stress signalling pathways.\nIn this report we have investigated the effect of silencing PINK1 expression in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells by siRNA on mtDNA synthesis and ETC function. Loss of PINK1 expression resulted in a decrease in mtDNA levels and mtDNA synthesis. We also report a concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased mitochondrial ATP synthesis, with the activity of complex IV of the ETC most affected. This mitochondrial dysfunction resulted in increased markers of oxidative stress under basal conditions and increased cell death following treatment with the free radical generator paraquat."},{"passage":"Endothelial dysfunction (ED) participates to atherogenesis associated to rheumatoid arthritis. We recently reported increased arginase activity\/expression in vessels from adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a curative treatment with the arginase inhibitor Nw-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA) on vascular dysfunction in AIA rats.\nAIA rats were treated with nor-NOHA (40 mg\/kg\/d, ip) for 21 days after the onset of arthritis. A group of untreated AIA rats and a group of healthy rats served as controls. ED was assessed by the vasodilatory effect of acetylcholine (Ach) on aortic rings. The role of superoxide anions, prostanoids, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway was studied. Plasma levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by ELISA kits. Arthritis severity was estimated by a clinical, radiological and histological analysis.\nNor-NOHA treatment fully restored the aortic response to Ach to that of healthy controls. The results showed that this beneficial effect is mediated by an increase in NOS activity and EDHF and reduced superoxide anion production as well as a decrease in the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, thromboxane and prostacyclins synthases. In addition, nor-NOHA decreased IL-6 and VEGF plasma levels in AIA rats.

The authors previously established that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulates proliferation and that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Later findings that ceramide triggers photoreceptor apoptosis suggested sphingolipids might also control photoreceptor development. The present study investigated whether sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), which promotes survival and differentiation in several cell types, regulates photoreceptor proliferation and differentiation and whether it is a mediator in GDNF and DHA effects.\nRat retina neuronal cultures were supplemented at day 0 or 1 with S1P, GDNF, or DHA and were treated with DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine to inhibit S1P synthesis or with brefeldin A (BFA) to block intracellular trafficking. Proliferation was quantified to determine bromodeoxyuridine uptake and number of mitotic figures. Opsin, peripherin, and sphingosine kinase (SphK), the enzyme required for S1P synthesis, were quantified by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis.\nS1P increased the proliferation of photoreceptor progenitors. It also stimulated the formation of apical processes, enhanced opsin and peripherin expression, and promoted their localization in these processes; DHA had similar effects. BFA prevented S1P and DHA enhancement of apical process formation without affecting opsin expression. GDNF and DHA enhanced SphK expression in photoreceptors, while inhibiting S1P synthesis blocked GDNF mitogenic effects and DHA effects on differentiation."},{"passage":"Prenatal stress constitutes a developmental risk factor for later psychopathology. The behavioral disorders are sustained by neurobiological alterations including long-term reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis; its deregulation has been involved in cognitive impairments, mood disorders and addiction.

We investigated the ability of a postnatal infantile stimulation to prevent prenatal stress-induced alteration in hippocampal neurogenesis.\nThe influence of postnatal handling on prenatal stress-induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis was examined in 4 and 26 month-old male rats. Three distinct phases of the neurogenesis were studied: proliferation, survival and neuronal differentiation.\nPrenatal stress reduced hippocampal cell proliferation all throughout life. Furthermore, the survival rate of newborn cells, the number of immature neurons and the number of differentiated new neurons were reduced in young and old prenatally-stressed rats. All those deleterious effects were counteracted by neonatal handling."},{"passage":"Walking is usually undertaken at a speed that coincides with the lowest metabolic cost. Aging however, alters the speed-cost relationship, as preferred walking speeds decrease and energy costs increase.

Accumulating evidence suggests an important role for PARP1 enzymatic activity in promoting CNS inflammation by facilitating the expression of inflammatory cytokines in glial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PARP1 enzymatic activity mediates this process are not well understood. In this report we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms by which PARP1 enzymatic activity facilitates the expression of Il1\u03b2 and TNF in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells.\nPARP1 enzymatic activity and histone ADP-ribosylation were measured in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells by radioactive labelling with (32)P-NAD(+). To assess the effect of histone ADP-ribosylation on nucleosome structure, in vitro nucleosome remodeling, nuclease accessibility and binding assays were performed. These studies were complemented by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in resting and LPS-stimulated BV2 cells in order to determine the occupancy of PARP1, nucleosomes and the RelA subunit of NF-\u03baB, as well as ADP-ribosylation, at the Il1\u03b2 and Tnf promoters. Finally, we determined the effect of pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity on the LPS stimulation-dependent induction of Il1\u03b2 and Tnf mRNA.\nOur results indicate that LPS stimulation induces PARP1 enzymatic activity and histone ADP-ribosylation in the chromatin compartment of BV2 cells. In vitro studies show that nucleosome-bound PARP1 disrupts nucleosome structure histone ADP-ribosylation, increasing the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with this PARP1 is constitutively associated with at the Il1\u03b2 and Tnf promoters in resting BV2 cells. Upon stimulation with LPS, ADP-ribosylation is observed at these promoters, and this is correlated with increased recruitment of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, resulting in robust transcription of these inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity reduces NF-\u03baB recruitment, and Il1\u03b2 and Tnf expression in LPS-stimulated microglia."},{"passage":"Recently, we reported the identification of a previously uncharacterized and evolutionarily conserved gene, fragile-site associated tumor suppressor (FATS), at a frequently deleted region in irradiation (IR)-induced tumors.

The relationship between FATS expression and clinicopathological parameters were also analyzed.\nThe mRNA level of FATS was down-regulated in breast cancer compared with paired normal tissues. Low expression of FATS was correlated with high nuclear grade. There was a tendency to a favorable outcome for patients with high expression of FATS (P = 0.346).

About 87.7% of the patients were treated with statins at the time of platelet function analysis. Residual platelet activity assessed by adenosine diphosphate (20 micromol\/L)-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly influenced by statin treatment. Nor the significant effects of CYP3A4-metabolization pathway on post-treatment aggregation were recorded, although there was even a trend to lower RPA values in patients treated with CYP3A4-metabolized statins. Further, in an inter-individual analysis comparing patients treated with CYP3A4- and non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins, no time-dependent difference of clopidogre\u013as anti-aggregatory effects was observed. Clinical follow-up of major adverse events (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, death) in 991 patients within 3 months revealed no significant adverse effects of statin treatment on clinical outcome.

A dmc1 mutation confers more severe defects in double strand break (DSB) resolution, crossover recombination and meiotic progression than does a rad51 mutant; in contrast, during return to growth, a rad51 mutation confers more severe defects in viability and intrachromosomal recombination than does a dmc1 mutation. Analysis of a rad51 dmc1 double mutant, in parallel with single mutants, shows that the double mutant is more defective with respect to the formation of crossovers during meiosis and, especially strikingly, with respect to interhomologue and intrachromosomal recombination during return to growth. Consistent with the observation of DMC1-dependent recombination in a rad51 mutant, subnuclear complexes of Dmc1 protein were detected for the first time in this mutant.

The function of miR-18a in regulating HIF1A expression, as well as cellular responses to hypoxia and metastasis, were then studied in vitro and in vivo by assessing ectopic miR-18a expression or miR-18a inhibition. miRNA-mRNA interactions (AGO2 immunoprecipitation and 3' untranslated region Luciferase reporter assays), gene expression (quantitative PCR and microarray), cell migration and invasion, and cell growth were assessed under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, complemented by orthotopic xenograft of tumor cells to the mammary fat pad to investigate the effect of modulating miR-18a expression on primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. Last, clinically relevant correlations between miR-18a, HIF1A, hypoxia-responsive gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were assessed using published expression array breast tumors data sets.\nmiRNAs encoded by the MIR17HG gene were downregulated in lung metastases compared to primary tumors. Ectopic expression of miR-18a, a MIR17HG family member, in a metastatic variant of MDA-MB-231 cells reduced primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, whereas miR-18a inhibition in the parental cells promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis. We identified HIF1A as a direct target of miR-18a. Modulating miR-18a expression significantly affected hypoxic gene expression, cell invasiveness and sensitivity to anoikis and hypoxia in vitro in a HIF1A-dependent manner. Analysis of previously published data revealed that higher expression of HIF1A and a panel of hypoxic genes is associated with shorter DMFS interval in patients with basal-like breast tumors, and that, within this subtype, miR-18a expression is inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression. Together, these data support a role of miR-18a in repressing distant metastasis through a HIF1A-dependent pathway."},{"passage":"Under certain circumstances, fyn may serve to negatively regulate the differentiation of na\u00efve helper T (Th) cells into Th2 cells.

We investigated four hypotheses regarding factors that affect blood-feeding rates, proportion of human-fed bugs (human blood index), and daily human-feeding rates of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease.\nA cross-sectional survey collected triatomines in human sleeping quarters (domiciles) of 49 of 270 rural houses in northwestern Argentina. We developed an improved way of estimating the human-feeding rate of domestic T. infestans populations. We fitted generalized linear mixed-effects models to a global model with six explanatory variables (chicken blood index, dog blood index, bug stage, numbers of human residents, bug abundance, and maximum temperature during the night preceding bug catch) and three response variables (daily blood-feeding rate, human blood index, and daily human-feeding rate). Coefficients were estimated via multimodel inference with model averaging.\nMedian blood-feeding intervals per late-stage bug were 4.1 days, with large variations among households. The main bloodmeal sources were humans (68%), chickens (22%), and dogs (9%). Blood-feeding rates decreased with increases in the chicken blood index. Both the human blood index and daily human-feeding rate decreased substantially with increasing proportions of chicken- or dog-fed bugs, or the presence of chickens indoors. Improved calculations estimated the mean daily human-feeding rate per late-stage bug at 0.231 (95% confidence interval, 0.157-0.305)."},{"passage":"Determination of the reliability of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool for rupture of the quadriceps tendon and for follow-up after surgical repair.\n11 patients (12 tendons) with a clinical suspicion of quadriceps tendon rupture were studied with ultrasonography in two planes.\nIn 9 cases we were able to confirm the results of the clinical examination using ultrasonography.

During the follow-up period, men treated with 16 Gy RT had stable testosterone levels (-1.1%\/year, p = 0.4), whereas men treated with 20 Gy had an annual decrease of 2.4% (p = 0.008). For the latter group, the testosterone decrease was most pronounced in the first 5 years, leveling off during the following 5 years. Additionally, more men treated with 20 Gy needed androgen substitution treatment. Our study showed an increased luteinizing hormone level for the men treated with 16 Gy, although this was not significant (p = 0.5).

This view has recently been challenged by reports of N170 modulations by emotional facial expression. This study examines the time-course and topography of the influence of emotional expression on the N170 response to faces.\nDense-array ERPs were recorded in response to a set (n = 16) of fear and neutral faces. Stimuli were normalized on dimensions of shape, size and luminance contrast distribution. To minimize task effects related to facial or emotional processing, facial stimuli were irrelevant to a primary task of learning associative pairings between a subsequently presented visual character and a spoken word.\nN170 to faces showed a strong modulation by emotional facial expression. A split half analysis demonstrates that this effect was significant both early and late in the experiment and was therefore not associated with only the initial exposures of these stimuli, demonstrating a form of robustness against habituation. The effect of emotional modulation of the N170 to faces did not show significant interaction with the gender of the face stimulus, or hemisphere of recording sites.

Protein variants were identified by immunoblot analysis and by immunocytochemistry.\nRPGR transcripts terminated either uniformly at the end of exon 19, producing the constitutive transcript with few variants, or at variable sites downstream from exon 15. The latter transcripts resembled the previously described open reading frame (ORF)14\/15 variant, but the ORF14\/15 exon was not found in full length. Instead, various portions of a purine-rich region were removed as introns. Numerous splice site combinations were used, giving rise to innumerable variants. Analysis of the purine-rich region found multiple exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) known to promote splicing through interaction with serine-arginine repeat (SR) proteins. Antibodies targeting different regions of RPGR detected a multitude of RPGR proteins in photoreceptors, concentrated in the connecting cilium.

Lung assessments included bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue morphology, immunostaining for markers of cell death, cell identity, phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK levels and oximetry.\nOA induced acute lung injury in a dose- and time-dependent manner. No injury was observed in the vehicle control or bpV(phen) treatment groups. PTEN inhibition by bpV(phen) increased lung tissue levels of phospho-Akt and ERK and but not focal adhesion kinase. This occurred in conjunction with a statistically significant reduction in protein content, lactate dehydrogenase, as well as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid when compared with OA treatment alone.

Serum endotoxin core antibody (EndoCab) concentration is a potential indicator of intestinal inflammation and integrity, and thus may be useful to predict environmental enteropathy. We analyzed the association of serum EndoCab levels versus linear growth and lactulose-mannitol assay results in 2-5 year old rural Malawian children.\nThis was an observational study of 388 rural, asymptomatic Malawian children who had anthropometric measurements taken at least every 3 months since birth. In June and July 2011, dual sugar permeability tests were performed and serum samples were drawn for EndoCab assays. Pearson correlation, Student's t test and multivariable linear regression were used to compare ln EndoCab concentrations with height-for-age z scores (HAZ) at time of sampling and 3 months later. Identical analysis was also performed for ln EndoCab versus measurements from dual sugar permeability testing performed in conjunction with serum sampling. In a subgroup of children with anthropometric data in the months prior to serum sampling, Pearson correlation was used to estimate the relationship between ln EndoCab and recent linear growth.\nLn EndoCab concentrations were not correlated with HAZ at time of measurement (B = -0.078, P = 0.14) nor change in HAZ over the subsequent 3 months HAZ (B = -0.018, P = 0.27). EndoCab concentration was not associated with %lactulose excretion (B < 0.001, P = 0.98) nor the lactulose:mannitol ratio (B = 0.021, P = 0.62). Subgroup analysis also did not reveal any significant association between EndoCab and recent growth."},{"passage":"Recent studies of cancer metastasis have focused on the role of premetastatic gene expression and circulating tumor cells. We did a blind prospective study in gastric cancer to assess the significance of isolated tumor cells (ITC) and to test the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) is expressed within the bone marrow at tumor-specific, premetastatic sites.\nBoth bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 810 gastric cancer patients were collected at the Central Hospital, National Cancer Center (Tokyo, Japan). The samples were transferred to Kyushu University Hospital (Beppu, Japan) where they were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR for three epithelial cell markers, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin-19, and cytokeratin-7, as well as VEGFR-1.\nITCs were observed in peripheral blood and bone marrow even in early stages of gastric cancer. The frequency of ITC in bone marrow was significantly associated with the stage of disease by ANOVA (P < 0.01). Gastric cancer metastasized when ITCs were observed in the presence of VEGFR-1. In the 380 patients who were ITC negative and showed low VEGFR-1 expression, synchronous (at the time of surgery) and heterochronous (recurrent) metastases were not observed."},{"passage":"Helicobacter pylori is known to affect the host's nutritional status. This study was performed to elucidate the relationship between H. pylori status and the dynamics of the ghrelin system, in the context of ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) expression.\nWe conducted a clinical study of 30 subjects focusing on the following points: 1) the effects of H. pylori infection on the concentrations of circulating ghrelin isoforms and on ghrelin and GOAT mRNA expression in the gastric mucosa, and 2) the effects of H. pylori eradication on the same parameters.\nThe plasma acyl-ghrelin and desacyl-ghrelin concentrations of 16 H. pylori positive participants were significantly lower than those of 14 H. pylori negative controls. The acyl-ghrelin\/desacyl-ghrelin ratio was not significantly different between the H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative participants. The levels of ghrelin and GOAT mRNA in the gastric mucosa were significantly lower in the H. pylori positive participants than in the H. pylori negative controls. In 11 subjects in whom H. pylori eradication was successful, their plasma acyl-ghrelin levels tended to increase after H. pylori eradication, but the difference was not significant; however, their plasma desacyl-ghrelin levels were significantly reduced. Although gastric ghrelin mRNA expression increased significantly after H. pylori eradication, gastric GOAT mRNA expression tended to increase but was not significantly altered."},{"passage":"HIV rapid testing programs in New York State (NYS) are required to collect a specimen for confirmation of a preliminary positive result; however, some venues have limited capacity to collect venous blood, and confirmation using oral fluid is restricted by cost and availability.\nTo evaluate the feasibility of using dried blood spots (DBS) at non-clinical HIV rapid testing sites for Western blot testing.\nThe New York State Department of Health facilitated registration of 48 non-clinical HIV test sites and provided training on DBS procedures. Following a reactive rapid test, DBS were collected by fingerstick onto filter paper cards, dried and mailed to the NYS public health laboratory for Western blot testing.\nFrom October 2010 to December 2012, 280 DBS specimens were submitted for confirmation. Four (1.4%) were unsatisfactory for testing and 276 (98.6%) DBS were tested. Of these, 235 (85.1%) were positive, 37 (13.4%) were negative and 4 (1.4%) were indeterminate.

It remains unclear to what degree airway inflammation contributes to the presence or progression of nutritional depletion.\nTo determine whether airway inflammation and lung bacterial colonization are related to nutritional status or predict progressive weight loss and muscle atrophy in patients with COPD.\nBody composition using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, indices of airway inflammation, and bacterial colonization were measured in 234 COPD patients. Systemic inflammation was assessed from serum C reactive protein (CRP) and circulating total and differential leukocyte counts. Nutritional depletion was defined as a body mass index (BMI) less than 21 kg\/m(2) and\/or fat-free mass index (FFMI) less than 15 or 17 kg\/m(2) in women and men, respectively. FFMI was calculated as the fat-free mass (FFM) corrected for body surface area. Measurements were repeated in 94 patients after a median 16-month follow-up. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationships of weight change and FFM change with indices of bacterial colonization and airway and systemic inflammation.\nNutritional depletion occurred in 37% of patients. Lung function was worsened in patients with nutritional depletion compared to those without (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 1.17 L versus 1.41 L, mean difference 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.38, P<0.01). There were no differences in airway inflammation and bacterial colonization in patients with and without nutritional depletion.

Here, the effects of SD at reduced flow conditions as encountered in the ischemic penumbra are examined.\nIn rats the right carotid artery was permanently occluded. MABP was lowered to 50 mmHg for 30 min. This is sufficient to reduce CBF to penumbra-like conditions in the right hemisphere. The following parameters were assessed: rCBF, DC potential, and tissue impedance. 5 or 15 min after onset of flow reduction one SD wave was initiated by microinjection of KCl. Histology was performed after 7 days.\nIn animals with hypotension there was depolarization resembling anoxic depolarization after SD induction and an uncoupling of CBF and metabolism only in the right hemisphere. Impedance increased with SD but did not recover spontaneously as long as rCBF remained reduced. 15 min of SD-induced cell swelling was tolerated without permanent damage, whereas 25 min were followed by severe neuron loss in the affected cortex after 7 days."},{"passage":"To determine the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis.\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in United States. Chronic intestinal inflammation increases the risk for the development of CRC. We investigated the involvement of AHR, a ligand-activated transcriptional regulator, in colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis.\nWe used a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis that employs treatment with azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. We examined the role of AHR using both an Ahr-deletion mouse model (Ahr) and treatment with the AHR pro-agonist indole-3-carbinol (I3C). Incidence, multiplicity, and location of tumors were visually counted. Tumors were defined as neoplasms. Intestinal inflammation was assessed by quantitative PCR for proinflammatory markers and colon length. Data were evaluated and compared using GraphPad Prism software (version 6, La Jolla, CA).\nTumor incidence was increased 32% in Ahr null mice and tumor multiplicity was approximately increased 3-fold compared with wild-type mice (2.4 vs 7; P < 0.05). Furthermore, tumor multiplicity was reduced 92% by treatment of I3C in wild-type mice, whereas the suppressor effect of I3C was not observed in Ahr null mice (P < 0.05)."},{"passage":"In patients, an association exists between pulmonary diseases and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). We have previously shown that alveolar hypoxia in mice induces LV diastolic dysfunction and that mice exposed to hypoxia have increased levels of circulating interleukin-18 (IL-18), suggesting involvement of IL-18 in development of diastolic dysfunction. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. In this study, we hypothesized that neutralization of IL-18 during alveolar hypoxia would improve LV diastolic function.\nMice were exposed to 10% oxygen for 2 weeks while treated with IL-18BP or vehicle. Cardiac function and morphology were measured using echocardiography, intraventricular pressure measurements and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For characterization of molecular changes in the heart, both real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed. ELISA technique was used to measure levels of circulating cytokines.\nAs expected, exposure to hypoxia-induced LV diastolic dysfunction, as shown by prolonged time constant of isovolumic relaxation (\u03c4). Improved relaxation with IL-18BP treatment was demonstrated by a significant reduction towards control \u03c4 values. Decreased levels of phosphorylated phospholamban (P-PLB) in hypoxia, but normalization by IL-18BP treatment suggest a role for IL-18 in regulation of calcium-handling proteins in hypoxia-induced diastolic dysfunction. In addition, MRI showed less increase in right ventricular (RV) wall thickness in IL-18BP-treated animals exposed to hypoxia, indicating an effect on RV hypertrophy."},{"passage":"Even though fever is a common symptom in childhood, it often worries parents and they may try to reduce discomfort by giving the child paracetamol, which is currently the most commonly sold over-the-counter medicine.

Overall, 28 patients (control group) received standard postoperative pain management including opiates, and 30 patients (PSC group) were treated with paraincisional continuous local analgesia with 0.25% ropivacaine administrated via bilateral subcutaneous catheters along with additional ad libitum opiates administration, at first intravenously and then orally.\nPatients characteristics as well as perioperative and postoperative outcomes were comparable between the groups during the first 5 days after surgery. Patients of the PSC group received significantly less morphine, although the patients in both groups reported a similar pain intensity. Neither wound-healing disorder nor catheter-associated subcutaneous infection was reported. High serum concentration of ropivacaine was detected in 2 patients (6%) with end-stage renal disease, who developed temporary neurologic symptoms.

Analyses of gene expression and cellular function were conducted 48\u00a0h after transfection.\nBoth miRNAs influenced the EZH2 expression and activity only marginally, whereas siR-EZH2 led to a notable decrease of the EZH2 expression and activity. Both miRNAs inhibited short- and\/or long-term proliferation of PCa cells but showed no effect on viability and apoptosis. In PC-3 cells, miR-26a and miR-138 caused a significant surplus of cells in the G0\/G1 phase of 6 and 12\u00a0%, respectively, thus blocking the G1\/S-phase transition. Treatment with siR-EZH2 was without substantial influence on cellular function and cell cycle. Therefore, alternative target genes involved in cell cycle regulation were identified in silico.

E-cigarette users expose their airways, cells of host defense, and colonizing bacteria to e-cigarette vapor (EV). Here, we report that exposure of human epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface to fresh EV (vaped from an e-cigarette device) resulted in dose-dependent cell death. After exposure to EV, cells of host defense-epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils-had reduced antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Mouse inhalation of EV for 1\u00a0h daily for 4\u00a0weeks led to alterations in inflammatory markers within the airways and elevation of an acute phase reactant in serum. Upon exposure to e-cigarette vapor extract (EVE), airway colonizer SA had increased biofilm formation, adherence and invasion of epithelial cells, resistance to human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and up-regulation of virulence genes. EVE-exposed SA were more virulent in a mouse model of pneumonia. These data suggest that e-cigarettes may be toxic to airway cells, suppress host defenses, and promote inflammation over time, while also promoting virulence of colonizing bacteria."},{"passage":"Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is an established therapy to support patients with heart failure during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

To begin to study the kinetics of channel blockade, we examined the time dependence of macroscopic current inhibition following a hyperpolarizing voltage step. Like glibenclamide, piretanide blockade of CFTR was time and voltage dependent. By contrast, furosemide blockade was voltage dependent, but time independent.

In vivo, secretoneurin-induced neovasculature is characterized by a distinct pattern of arterial and venous vessels of large diameter and length. Immunohistochemical staining for CD-31 revealed endothelial lining of the inner surface of these vessels, and recruitment of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive perivascular cells suggests vessel maturation. In vitro, secretoneurin-induced capillary tube formation was dose dependent and specific, confirming that effects of secretoneurin occur directly on endothelial cells.

We investigated the role of LXR signaling stellate cell activation and susceptibility to fibrotic liver disease.\nImmortalized and primary stellate cells purified from mice were treated with highly specific LXR ligands. Carbon tetrachloride and methionine\/choline deficiency were used as chronic liver injury models. Reciprocal bone marrow transplants were performed to test the importance of hematopoietically derived cells to the fibrotic response.\nLXR ligands suppressed markers of fibrosis and stellate cell activation in primary mouse stellate cells. Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-\/-) stellate cells produce increased levels of inflammatory mediators, and conditioned media from Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-\/-) cells increases the fibrogenic program of wild-type cells. Furthermore, Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-\/-) stellate cells exhibit altered lipid morphology and increased expression of fibrogenic genes, suggesting they are primed for activation. In vivo, Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-\/-) mice have marked susceptibility to fibrosis in 2 injury models. Bone marrow transplants point to altered stellate cell function, rather than hematopoietic cell inflammation, as the primary basis for the Lxr\u03b1\u03b2(-\/-) phenotype."},{"passage":"ZP120 (Ac-RYYRWKKKKKKK-NH(2)), is a new partial nociceptin\/orphanin FQ (NOP) receptor agonist with sodium-potassium sparing aquaretic effects. The mechanisms of vasodilatation of ZP120 were examined in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.\nArterial segments (internal diameters 206+\/-4 microm, n=224) were mounted in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recordings and electrical field stimulation (EFS).\nZP120 and the endogenous NOP receptor ligand, N\/OFQ, did not relax arteries contracted with noradrenaline or adenosine-triphosphate. EFS-evoked contractions were inhibited by a purinoceptor antagonist, suramin, and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. N\/OFQ inhibited, concentration-dependently, EFS-evoked contractions with a maximal effect of 52+\/-3% (n=8) at 1 microM. The maximal effect of 1 microM ZP120 was lower (27+\/-5%, P<0.05, n=9) than for N\/OFQ. Endothelial removal or pretreatment with capsaicin did not influence the vasodilator effects of ZP120 and N\/OFQ. ZP120 and N\/OFQ responses were preserved in the presence of suramin. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine, antagonized the effect of clonidine and brimonidine, but ZP120 and N\/OFQ inhibition of EFS-evoked contraction was unaltered. The competitive NOP receptor antagonist, UFP-101 (10 microM), prevented the inhibitory effect of N\/OFQ, but not ZP120 suggesting that N\/OFQ and ZP120 have distinct modes of interaction with the NOP receptor."},{"passage":"The Th2 cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

We used the FRTL-5 cell line, an epithelial monoclonal continuous cell line derived from Fisher rat thyroid tissue growing as monolayer, expressing the TSH receptor and the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). FRTL-5 were subsequently irradiate for 24, 48, and 96 h with EMF (800-900 MHz, power-frequency of mobile communication systems) and iodide uptake and cAMP production were measured.\nThe irradiation of cells with EMF at 900 Mhz for 24, 48, and 96 h did not influence the level of cAMP production and was not able to modify iodide accumulation in FRTL- 5 cells with respect to basal conditions."},{"passage":"The development of advanced endoscopic instrumentation in recent years has demonstrated the superiority of direct visual examination over radiographic demonstration of various body cavities.

As there is evidence for neurobiological gender differences in ASD, we also examined the influence of biological sex.\nTMS pulses were applied to each of the three sites (right lateralized) during 20-channel EEG recording.\nWe did not identify any differences in the EEG response to TMS between ASD and control groups. This finding remained when data were stratified by sex.

As most opioid agonists are selective but not specific, a broad spectrum of behaviours due to activation of different opioid receptors is expected. In this study, we examine whether other opioid receptor systems influenced KOP-mediated antinociception.\nWe used a tail withdrawal assay in C57Bl\/6 mice to assay the antinociceptive effect of systemically administered opioid agonists with varying selectivity at KOP receptors. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to analyse the interactions of the other opioid receptors in modulating KOP-mediated antinociception.\nEtorphine, a potent agonist at all four opioid receptors, was not anti-nociceptive in MOP knockout (KO) mice, although etorphine is an efficacious KOP receptor agonist and specific KOP receptor agonists remain analgesic in MOP KO mice. As KOP receptor agonists are aversive, we considered KOP-mediated antinociception might be a form of stress-induced analgesia that is blocked by the anxiolytic effects of DOP receptor agonists. In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the DOP antagonist, naltrindole (10\u2009mg\u00b7kg(-1) ), unmasked etorphine (3\u2009mg\u00b7kg(-1) ) antinociception in MOP KO mice. Further, in wild-type mice, KOP-mediated antinociception by systemic U50,488H (10\u2009mg\u00b7kg(-1) ) was blocked by pretreatment with the DOP agonist SNC80 (5\u2009mg\u00b7kg(-1) ) and diazepam (1\u2009mg\u00b7kg(-1) )."},{"passage":"Human bitter taste receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of 25 functional TAS2R loci. In addition, humans carry 11 TAS2R pseudogenes, some of which display evidence for substantial diversification among species, showing lineage-specific loss of function. Since bitter taste is thought to help prevent the intake of toxic substances, diversity at TAS2R genes could reflect the action of natural selection on the ability to recognize some bitter compounds rather than others. Whether species-specific variation in TAS2R pseudogenes is solely the result of genetic drift or whether it may have been influenced by selection due to different feeding behaviors has been an open question.\nIn this study, we analyzed patterns of variation at human TAS2R pseudogenes in both African and non-African populations, and compared them to those observable in nonhuman primates and archaic human species. Our results showed a similar worldwide distribution of allelic variation for most of the pseudogenes, with the exception of the TAS2R6P and TAS2R18P loci, both of which presented an unexpected higher frequency of derived alleles outside Africa. At the TAS2R6P locus, two SNPs were found in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2\u2009>\u20090.9) with variants in the functional TAS2R5 gene, which showed signatures of selection. The human TAS2R18P carried a species-specific stop-codon upstream of four polymorphic insertions in the reading frame.

The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between mutations in HFE, hepatitis C and porphyria cutanea tarda.\nThe frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE were determined in 27 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and compared with the reported control frequencies. In addition, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection was identified and related to the patients' HFE status.\nThe C282Y mutation was found in 44.4% of patients compared with the control frequency of 12% (p<0.001). Three patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, two of whom did not meet current clinical diagnostic criteria for expressed haemochromatosis. The proportion of patients with the H63D mutation did not differ from the reported control frequency. The mean transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration were similar in porphyria cutanea tarda patients who were homozygous normal and heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, but greater in both groups than previously reported in healthy controls. Seven (25.9%) patients were anti-HCV IgG positive. None of these patients carried the C282Y mutation.

Epidemiological studies support the role of antioxidants in the etiology of cataract, but the evidence for one specific antioxidant over another is inconsistent. Few studies have examined the association of cataract with fruit and vegetable intake with inconclusive results. In the present study, the relationship between cataract and fruit and vegetable intake and dietary and blood levels of carotenoids, vitamins C and E were examined in a Spanish Mediterranean population.\nThe present work is an analysis of data from 599 elderly ( \u2265 65 years) participants from the Spanish segment of the EUREYE study. This is a European multi-center cross-sectional population-based study. Cataract was diagnosed using a slit-lamp examination and defined as any lens opacity in either eye or evidence of its removal (cataract extraction). Energy-adjusted intake of fruit and vegetables and antioxidant vitamins was estimated using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C were analyzed by a colorimetric method and carotenoids and \u03b1-tocopherol by a HPLC method. The associations between cataract and quartiles of fruit and vegetable intake and plasma antioxidants were investigated using logistic regression models.\nOf the 599 elderly recruited, 433 (73%) had cataract or cataract extraction, 54% were women and 46% were men. After adjustments, increasing quartiles of combined fruit and vegetable intake were associated with decreasing reduction of odds of cataract or cataract extraction, (P for trend = 0.008). Increasing quartiles of dietary intakes from 107 mg\/d of vitamin C showed a significant decreasing association with prevalence of cataract or cataract extraction (P for trend = 0.047).

We investigated the impact of RB loss on carcinogen-induced liver tumorigenesis.\nMice harboring liver-specific RB ablation and normal littermates were exposed to the hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). The influence of RB loss on liver tumorigenesis was assessed by evaluating tumor multiplicity, proliferation, and genome integrity within tumors arising in RB-deficient and wild-type livers. In silico analyses were used to probe the association between gene expression signatures for RB loss and chromosomal instability and the ability of genes up-regulated by RB loss to predict the survival of human HCC patients.\nRB deficiency significantly increased tumor multiplicity in livers exposed to DEN. Although hepatocytes in nontumor regions of DEN-exposed livers were quiescent regardless of RB status, tumors arising in RB-deficient livers were significantly more proliferative than those in normal livers and expressed high levels of RB\/E2F target genes. Analysis of genes up-regulated by RB loss demonstrated significant overlap with a gene expression signature associated with chromosomal instability. Correspondingly, tumors arising in RB-deficient livers were significantly more likely to harbor hepatocytes exhibiting altered ploidy. Finally, gene expression analysis of human HCCs demonstrated that elevated expression of RB-regulated genes independently predicts poor survival."},{"passage":"Ageing induces changes in gut microbiota that may affect the quality of life.

We have shown previously that one of the earliest pathogenic events in PV is the activation of protein kinases, including the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase PERK.\nIn the present study we investigated in more detail the role of PERK in the pathogenesis of PV.\nPERK levels were assessed by Western blotting and in-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PERK expression was silenced by siRNA technology. The effects of PV sera\/IgG on keratinocyte cultures were investigated by flow cytometry, MTT and adhesion assays.\nWe show that PERK is activated in keratinocytes exposed to PV serum, as demonstrated by an increase in phosphorylated PERK levels and phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Decreased expression of PERK by siRNA reduced the effects of PV serum on the cell cycle and keratinocyte viability, two key events in PV pathophysiology. As impairment of metabolic activity in PV is partially due to non-IgG serum factors, we then investigated the activation of PERK in keratinocytes incubated with whole PV serum, purified PV IgG and IgG-depleted PV serum. The data demonstrated that PV sera depleted of IgG, but not PV IgG, triggered PERK phosphorylation and this correlated with a marked reduction of metabolic activity in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-free serum. Knockdown of PERK by siRNA abrogated the changes in the cell cycle and apoptosis induced by IgG-depleted PV serum. Finally, the reduction of metabolic activity observed in keratinocytes exposed to IgG-depleted PV serum was almost absent in PERK-deficient cells."},{"passage":"Occupational vinyl chloride (VC) exposures have been associated with toxicant-associated steatohepatitis and liver cancer. Metabolomics has been used to clarify mode of action in drug-induced liver injury but has not been performed following VC exposures.\nPlasma samples from 17 highly exposed VC workers without liver cancer and 27 unexposed healthy volunteers were obtained for metabolite extraction and GC\/MS and LC\/MS\n613 unique named metabolites were identified. Of these, 189 metabolites were increased in the VC exposure group while 94 metabolites were decreased. Random Forest analysis indicated that the metabolite signature could separate the groups with 94% accuracy. VC exposures were associated with increased long chain (including arachidonic acid) and essential (including linoleic acid) fatty acids. Occupational exposure increased lipid peroxidation products including monohydroxy fatty acids (including 13-HODE); fatty acid dicarboxylates; and oxidized arachidonic acid products (including 5,9, and 15-HETE). Carnitine and carnitine esters were decreased, suggesting peroxisomal\/mitochondrial dysfunction and alternate modes of lipid oxidation. Differentially regulated metabolites were shown to interact with extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1\/2 (ERK1\/2), Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.

Survival rates were monitored and plasma indices of organ function were measured. Ex vivo studies included the measurement of vascular function in thoracic aortic rings, assessment of oxidative stress\/cellular injury in various organs and the measurement of mitochondrial function in isolated liver mitochondria.\neNOS deficiency and aging both exacerbated the mortality of sepsis. Both eNOS-deficient and aged mice exhibited a higher degree of sepsis-associated multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), infiltration of tissues with mononuclear cells and oxidative stress. A high degree of sepsis-induced vascular oxidative damage and endothelial dysfunction (evidenced by functional assays and multiple plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction) was detected in aortae isolated from both eNOS(-\/-) and aged mice.

During dorsal closure the JNK signaling cascade in the dorsal-most (leading edge) cells of the epidermis activates the AP-1 transcription factor comprised of DJUN and DFOS that, in turn, upregulates the expression of the dpp gene. DPP is a secreted morphogen that signals lateral epidermal cells to elongate along the dorsoventral axis. The leading edge cells contact the peripheral cells of a monolayer extraembryonic epithelium, the amnioserosa, which lies on the dorsal side of the embryo. Focal complexes are present at the dorsal-most membrane of the leading edge cells, where they contact the amnioserosa.\nWe show that the JNK signaling cascade is initially active in both the amnioserosa and the leading edge of the epidermis. JNK signaling is downregulated in the amnioserosa, but not in the leading edge, prior to dorsal closure. The subcellular localization of DFOS and DJUN is responsive to JNK signaling in the amnioserosa: JNK activation results in nuclear localization of DFOS and DJUN; the downregulation of JNK signaling results in the relocalization of DFOS and DJUN to the cytoplasm. The HINDSIGHT (HNT) Zn-finger protein and the PUCKERED (PUC) JNK phosphatase are essential for downregulation of the JNK cascade in the amnioserosa. Persistent JNK activity in the amnioserosa leads to defective focal complexes in the adjacent leading edge cells and to the failure of dorsal closure."},{"passage":"Skin cancers are the most frequent malignancies in organ transplant recipients (OTRs).

Kv3 channels have specialized gating properties that facilitate high-frequency, repetitive firing in fast-spiking neurons. Mutations in human Kv3.3 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), an autosomal dominant genetic disease that exists in distinct neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative forms. To assess the potential usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for SCA13, we have characterized the functional properties of zebrafish Kv3.3 channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause SCA13.\nThe zebrafish genome (release Zv8) contains six Kv3 family members including two Kv3.1 genes (kcnc1a and kcnc1b), one Kv3.2 gene (kcnc2), two Kv3.3 genes (kcnc3a and kcnc3b), and one Kv3.4 gene (kcnc4). Both Kv3.3 genes are expressed during early development. Zebrafish Kv3.3 channels exhibit strong functional and structural homology with mammalian Kv3.3 channels. Zebrafish Kv3.3 activates over a depolarized voltage range and deactivates rapidly. An amino-terminal extension mediates fast, N-type inactivation. The kcnc3a gene is alternatively spliced, generating variant carboxyl-terminal sequences. The R335H mutation in the S4 transmembrane segment, analogous to the SCA13 mutation R420H, eliminates functional expression. When co-expressed with wild type, R335H subunits suppress Kv3.3 activity by a dominant negative mechanism.

The timed up-and-go (TUG) was completed to assess mobility.\nWhen standing without vibration, participants with lower foot sole vibratory thresholds (better sensation) had greater mediolateral (ML) sway complexity (r (2)\u2009=\u20090.49, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and those with greater ML sway complexity had faster TUG times (better mobility) (r (2)\u2009=\u20090.38, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Foot sole vibrations at 70 and 85\u00a0% of sensory threshold increased ML sway complexity during eyes-open and eyes-closed standing (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Importantly, these vibration-induced increases in complexity correlated with improvements in the TUG test of mobility (r (2)\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009~\u20090.42, p\u2009<\u20090.001\u2009~\u20090.03)."},{"passage":"In proteinuric nephropathies with increasingly severe defects of the glomerular filtering barrier, interstitial fibrogenesis is a major effector of scarring. An early event in this process is the peritubular accumulation of myofibroblasts that express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and contribute to abnormal matrix production. Common trigger factors are poorly understood. Enhanced protein trafficking may play a role by up-regulating inflammatory and fibrogenic genes in proximal tubular cells.\nThe remnant kidney model in rats was used to (1) analyze interactions between activated proximal tubular cells, peritubular cells expressing the myofibroblast marker, and inflammatory cells at time intervals (days 7, 14, and 30) after surgery, and (2) evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) on protein trafficking, fibrogenic signaling, and alpha-SMA expression.\nAbnormal uptake of ultrafiltered proteins by proximal tubular cells (IgG staining) occurred at an early stage (day 7) and was subsequently associated with macrophage and alpha-SMA+ cell accumulation into the peritubular interstitium. alpha-SMA+ cells clustered with macrophages into the interstitium. These changes were associated with appearance of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA in proximal tubular cells and in the infiltrating cells with time. At day 30, focal alpha-SMA staining also was found in the tubular cells and in peritubular endothelial cells on semithin ultracryosections. ACEi prevented both proteinuria and abnormal protein accumulation in tubular cells, as well as the inflammatory and fibrogenic reaction with peritubular alpha-SMA expression."},{"passage":"Current staging for renal cancer (RC) does not directly rely on tumor size.

Pathologic stages were T1a in 566, T1b in 490, T2 in 303, T3 in 831, and T4 in 55 patients. Tumor size was 0.5-25 cm (mean, 6.8). Multivariate models relied on 1997 and 2002 TNM variables and addressed N+, M+ disease, and CCS. Their accuracy was compared according to either the presence or absence of tumor size.\nIn all univariate and multivariate models, tumor size was a statistically significant predictor of all outcomes (p< or =0.001).

Repeated standardized 24-hour diet recalls and 24-hour urine collections were collected over up to three years of follow-up to estimate sodium and potassium intakes. By contrasting self-reported and urine-based sodium and potassium data collected before and during interventions, we examined the relative impact of intervention assignment on estimated intakes, repeatability, and multivariate measurement error.\nRelative to urine-based measures, mean self-reported sodium intakes were biased about 10% lower among participants assigned to combined weight loss and sodium reduction, but were unaffected by the other interventions.

Evidence suggests that the CNGRC motif is an APN ligand which targets tumor vasculature. Increased expression of APN in tumor vascular endothelium, therefore, offers an opportunity for targeted delivery of NGR peptide-linked drugs to tumors.\nTo determine whether an additional cyclic CNGRC sequence could improve endothelial cell homing and antitumor effect, human plasminogen kringle 5 (hPK5) was modified genetically to introduce a CNGRC motif (NGR-hPK5) and was subsequently expressed in yeast. The biological activity of NGR-hPK5 was assessed and compared with that of wild-type hPK5, in vitro and in vivo. NGR-hPK5 showed more potent antiangiogenic activity than wild-type hPK5: the former had a stronger inhibitory effect on proliferation, migration and cord formation of vascular endothelial cells, and produced a stronger antiangiogenic response in the CAM assay. To evaluate the tumor-targeting ability, both wild-type hPK5 and NGR-hPK5 were (99 m)Tc-labeled, for tracking biodistribution in the in vivo tumor model. By planar imaging and biodistribution analyses of major organs, NGR-hPK5 was found localized to tumor tissues at a higher level than wild-type hPK5 (approximately 3-fold). Finally, the effects of wild-type hPK5 and NGR-modified hPK5 on tumor growth were investigated in two tumor model systems. NGR modification improved tumor localization and, as a consequence, effectively inhibited the growth of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Colo 205) cells in tumor-bearing mice."},{"passage":"Ischemic preconditioning protects the heart against subsequent prolonged ischemia by opening of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels.

Population-based PCa screening includes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement with or without a DRE. PSA and DRE screening provide greater sensitivity than PSA alone; however, the increased participation rate resulting from PSA-alone screening may result in a greater detection rate.\nWe performed a survey of 13,580 healthy men undergoing PSA-only population-based screening. In addition to the basic demographic information, the survey asked whether the participant would still be willing to participate in the screening if it included a DRE. We modeled the willingness to participate to assess the effect of PSA screening versus PSA and DRE screening on the basis of previously published data and our results.\nThe results of our study indicated that only 78% of men would participate in screening that included both DRE and PSA. Thus, 7800 men of a theoretical population of 10,000 would participate in a screening that included both DRE and PSA. The positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng\/mL and\/or abnormal DRE) would then have been 2013, with 472 PCa cases and 1540 negative biopsies. In the PSA-alone arm, all 10,000 men would have agreed to participate, and the positive screen rate (PSA > or = 4.0 ng\/mL) would have been 1480, with 499 PCa cases and 980 negative biopsies. The PSA-alone arm would thus have detected 27 more cancers and performed 560 fewer negative biopsies."},{"passage":"Reactivity and titers of autoantibodies vary during the course of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and some autoantibodies have been associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes after treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the autoantibody behavior in AIH and its significance as predictors of biochemical and histological remission. A total of 117 patients with AIH (mean age 18.6 [4-69] years) were evaluated and tested for autoantibodies at disease onset and successively (mean 3.2 [2-6] times) after a mean follow-up evaluation of 70 [20-185] months. Antismooth muscle (ASMA), antiliver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), antiliver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1), antimitochondrial, antinuclear (ANA), and antiactin antibodies (AAA) were determined at disease onset and 379 other times during the follow-up evaluation through indirect immunofluorescence in rodent tissues, HEp-2 cells, and human fibroblasts. Anti-SLA\/LP were assessed 45 times in the follow-up evaluation of 19 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon admission, AIH types 1 and 2 were observed in 95 and 17 patients, respectively. Five subjects had AIH with anti-SLA\/LP as the sole markers. Patients initially negative for AAA did not develop these antibodies thereafter. ANA were detected de novo in six and three subjects with AIH types 1 and 2, respectively.

Although no viremia was ever detected in these animals, they showed significant increases in anti-gp140 Ab titers after they had encountered live SHIVs. When we investigated the dynamics of anti-Env Ab titers during the immunization and challenge phases further, we detected the expected, vaccine-induced increases of Ab responses about two weeks after the last protein immunization. Remarkably, these titers kept rising during the repeated virus challenges, although no viremia resulted. In contrast, in vaccinated RMs that were not exposed to virus, anti-gp140 Ab titers declined after the peak seen two weeks after the last immunization. These data suggest boosting of pre-existing, vaccine-induced Ab responses as a consequence of repeated live-virus exposures. Next, we screened polyclonal plasma samples from two of the completely protected vaccinees by peptide phage display and designed a strategy that selects for recombinant phages recognized only by Abs present after - but not before - any SHIV challenge. With this \"subtractive biopanning\" approach, we isolated V3 mimotopes that were only recognized after the animals had been exposed to live virus. By detailed epitope mapping of such anti-V3 Ab responses, we showed that the challenges not only boosted pre-existing binding and neutralizing Ab titers, but also induced Abs targeting neo-antigens presented by the heterologous challenge virus."},{"passage":"Identification of the risk factors of multicentric hepatocarcinogenesis is important for the clinical management of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Surgically resected livers from 155 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically.\nHyperplastic foci were found in 26 of 155 patients (16.8%). All the patients with hyperplastic foci had chronic liver diseases, and the incidence did not differ between those with chronic hepatitis and those with liver cirrhosis. Six of 92 (6.5%) patients with single primary hepatocellular carcinoma nodules, 8 of 42 (19.0%) with two nodules, and 12 of 21 (57.0%) with more than three nodules had hyperplastic foci.

Cytokine levels were compared with each other and with standard clinicopathologic parameters. A stepwise logistic regression was calculated to rule out interdependence in the associations of the various variables. Survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and differences in survival were examined according to Mantel and Breslow. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors.\nWhereas IL-10 and IL-12 were detectable in all ascites-fluid samples, IL-4 was measurable in only 43% of the specimens.

Five pigs that underwent infrarenal aortic cross-clamping (IR AXC) for 60 minutes and 11 pigs that underwent SC AXC for 30 minutes served as controls. No heparin was used. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 5 minutes before release of the aortic clamp, and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after unclamping. Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen concentration were measured as basic tests of hemostatic function. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes were used to detect the presence of intravascular thrombosis. Fibrinolytic pathway activation was assessed with levels of tissue plasminogen activator antigen and tissue plasminogen activator activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity, and alpha2-antiplasmin activity.

The role of Mac-1 in the pathophysiology of restenosis is incompletely defined. To clarify further the role of Mac-1, we determined whether coronary stenting induced activation of Mac-1, which is required for high-affinity receptor-ligand interactions.\nExpression of CD11b (alpha-subunit of Mac-1) and binding of 8B2 (monoclonal antibody against an activation-dependent neoepitope of Mac-1) on the surface of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were analyzed in 62 patients undergoing coronary stenting using flow cytometric analysis of whole blood obtained from the coronary sinus and femoral vein. Transcardiac CD11b expression increased significantly at 24 hours and maximally at 48 hours after stenting; 8B2 began to increase at 10 minutes and was maximally increased at 48 hours after stenting. These changes were more prominent in patients with subsequent restenosis. Multiple regression analysis showed that the late lumen loss by quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was independently correlated with the CD11b increase (R=0.42, P<0.01) and the 8B2 increase (R=0.55, P<0.001) 48 hours after the procedure.

Thirty stents (metal, n = 10; pimecrolimus slow, n = 10; pimecrolimus fast, n = 10) were implanted in the coronary arteries of 10 pigs. At 30 days, neointimal proliferation and inflammation were both significantly less in the pimecrolimus fast release group as compared with the bare metal controls. Endothelialization was complete and equal in all three groups of stents. In the second phase of the study, stents were loaded with an erodible polymer with alternating reservoirs of paclitaxel and pimecrolimus. Twenty stents (8 control stents and 12 dual stents) were implanted in the coronary arteries of seven pigs. At 30 days, neointimal proliferation was significantly less in the dual drug group as compared with the bare metal controls.

Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells.\nU937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and\/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice.\nGene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis."},{"passage":"Pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia (PE) is generally recognized by impaired trophoblast invasion of the myometrial arteries, which results in placental insufficiency.

Using a CDX1 stable transfected cell line, we determined the cell invasion using a QCM ECMatrix 24-well kit. The cell viability was detected using an MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the changes in the expression of downstream target genes and proteins. To disrupt PI3K\/AKT signaling, we used the PI3K inhibitor perifosine.\nCell invasion assays demonstrated that CDX1 restricts trophoblast cell invasiveness. In contrast, quantification of cumulative cell numbers revealed that CDX1 did not affect cell proliferation. Western blotting analysis and quantitative real time PCR demonstrated that MMP-9 expression was reduced, whereas TIMP-1 expression was increased in CDX1-overexpressed cells.

The effects of Ob-X on adipose tissue growth were investigated in nutritionally obese mice.\nOb-X inhibited angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay in vitro and the rat aortic ring assay ex vivo. Ob-X also suppressed MMP activity in vitro. Administration of Ob-X to high fat diet-induced obese mice produced significant reductions in body weight gain and adipose tissue mass compared with control. The mass of both visceral (VSC) and subcutaneous (SC) fat was reduced in Ob-X-treated mice. The size of adipocytes in VSC and SC adipose tissues was also significantly reduced in Ob-X-treated mice. Ob-X treatment decreased the blood vessel density and MMP activity in VSC adipose tissues of nutritionally obese mice. Ob-X reduced mRNA levels of angiogenic factors (VEGF-A and FGF-2) and MMPs (MMP-2 and MMP-9), whereas it increased mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors (TSP-1, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) in SC and VSC adipose tissues of nutritionally obese mice."},{"passage":"The failure of cancer treatments is partly due to the enrichment of cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

Intracellular uptake of CSO-SA\/OXA micelles was assessed by confocal microscope. The effects of free OXA, the empty carrier, and CSO-SA\/OXA micelles were tested using human CRC cell lines in vitro and in vivo.\nThe micelles showed excellent internalization ability that increased OXA accumulation both in CRC cells and tissues. Furthermore, CSO-SA\/OXA micelles could either increase the cytotoxicity of OXA against the bulk cancer cells or reverse chemoresistance of CSLC subpopulations in vitro. Intravenous administration of CSO-SA\/OXA micelles effectively suppressed the tumor growth and reduced CD133+\/CD24+ cell (putative CRC CSLC markers) compared with free OXA treatment, which caused CSLC enrichment in xenograft tumors (P < 0.05)."},{"passage":"Olfactory dysfunction is considered to precede motor symptoms and early markers of Parkinson's disease (PD), while the relative time at which cardiovascular dysautonomia appears in PD is not well understood.

Immunohistochemical analysis was also utilized to examine the stromal changes in tumor specimens obtained from patients with NSCLC who had undergone chemotherapy.\nIL-6 significantly increased transforming growth factor-\u03b21-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) changes in cancer cells. Cisplatin treatment increased expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 in cancer cells, and the conditioned media from cancer cells activated fibroblasts and increased their IL-6 production. Expression of IL-6 was increased in CAFs compared with in lung normal fibroblasts. The conditioned media from CAFs induced EMT and resistance to cisplatin in NSCLC cells through IL-6 signaling.

An endotracheal tube tip probe (ETTP) was used to push one arytenoid complex, and a non-slip probe (NSP) was tested on the other. Increasing pressure was applied until the probes either slipped or reached 5 kg of force. Dissection was then performed to assess the integrity of the cricoarytenoid ligament. The forces obtained by pushing an endotracheal tube against an electronic balance were measured to estimate the maximal possible intubating force.\nNone of the ETTP or NSP trials disrupted the cricoarytenoid joint ligaments, and the joint never appeared to be dislocated. The mean maximal forces were 1.8 kg for the ETTP (after which, slippage consistently occurred) and 4.7 kg for the NSP. The mean maximal forces from an endotracheal tube pushed against a scale were 1.5 kg (without stylet) and 4.6 kg (with stylet)."},{"passage":"Alterations in microvascular function have been hypothesized as a possible mechanism explaining the negative association of weight at birth with blood pressure and insulin resistance in adult life.

This study examined whether IEI can be distinguished from SFD with respect to self-reported symptoms, trait anxiety, body-related cognitions, and symptom attributions.\nWe compared 54 subjects with IEI, 54 subjects with SFD but without IEI, and 44 subjects with neither IEI nor SFD on symptom scales, psychological questionnaires, and structured interviews for IEI, depression, anxiety, and SFD.\nMore than half of the IEI subjects met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria of SFD. This group shared both symptoms and psychological features of somatization with the SFD group. IEI subjects who did not fulfill criteria for a specific SFD were less impaired by their chemical sensitivity but differed nevertheless from nonsomatoform controls by significantly higher symptom scores, higher trait anxiety, a focus on autonomic sensations, and more pronounced somatic symptom attributions.

Sensitivity to X-ray irradiation of these cell lines was determined with a colony survival assay. The suppression of GRP94 expression was performed using specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in HeLa and Caski cells.\nHeLa cells and QG-U cells, with higher basal levels of GRP94, exhibited a low sensitivity to X-ray cell killing. In HeLa cells, the sensitivity increased when protein GRP94 levels were reduced by specific siRNA transfection.

This occurs due to an aberrant vasculature as well as high rates of glycolysis and lactate production in tumor cells even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect), which weakens the spatial linkage between hypoxia and acidosis.\nFive different human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (SiHa, FaDuDD, UTSCC5, UTSCC14 and UTSCC15) were treated with hypoxia, acidosis (pH 6.3), or a combination, and gene expression analyzed using microarray. SiHa and FaDuDD were chosen for further characterization of cell energetics and protein synthesis. Total cellular ATP turnover and relative glycolytic dependency was determined by simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and lactate synthesis rates and total protein synthesis was determined by autoradiographic quantification of the incorporation of 35S-labelled methionine and cysteine into protein.\nMicroarray analysis allowed differentiation between genes induced at low oxygen only at normal extracellular pH (pHe), genes induced at low oxygen at both normal and low pHe, and genes induced at low pHe independent of oxygen concentration. Several genes were found to be upregulated by acidosis independent of oxygenation. Acidosis resulted in a more wide-scale change in gene expression profiles than hypoxia including upregulation of genes involved in the translation process, for example Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A, isoform 2 (EIF4A2), and Ribosomal protein L37 (RPL37). Acidosis suppressed overall ATP turnover and protein synthesis by 50%. Protein synthesis, but not total ATP production, was also suppressed under hypoxic conditions.

However, enhancement of particular aspects of cAMP\/protein kinase A signaling seems to be beneficial for the failing heart. cAMP is a pleiotropic second messenger with the ability to generate multiple functional outcomes in response to different extracellular stimuli with strict fidelity, a feature that relies on the spatial segregation of the cAMP pathway components in signaling microdomains.\nHow individual cAMP microdomains affect cardiac pathophysiology remains largely to be established. The cAMP-degrading enzymes phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play a key role in shaping local changes in cAMP. Here we investigated the effect of specific inhibition of selected PDEs on cardiac myocyte hypertrophic growth.\nUsing pharmacological and genetic manipulation of PDE activity, we found that the rise in cAMP resulting from inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 induces hypertrophy, whereas increasing cAMP levels via PDE2 inhibition is antihypertrophic. By real-time imaging of cAMP levels in intact myocytes and selective displacement of protein kinase A isoforms, we demonstrate that the antihypertrophic effect of PDE2 inhibition involves the generation of a local pool of cAMP and activation of a protein kinase A type II subset, leading to phosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells."},{"passage":"Emerging data demonstrate important roles for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast to endothelial cells, little is known about the regulation of t-PA gene expression and secretion in astrocytes.\nThe aims of the present study were to investigate whether t-PA gene expression is regulated by retinoids and the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in human astrocytes, and to study whether t-PA is stored and subject to regulated release from these cells, as with endothelial cells.\nNative human astrocytes were treated with RA and\/or PMA. mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and protein secretion determined by ELISA. Intracellular t-PA immunoreactivity in astrocytes was examined by immunocyto- and histochemistry.\nRA and\/or PMA induced a time-dependent increase in t-PA mRNA and protein levels in astrocytes, reaching 10-fold after combined treatment. This was associated with increased amounts of t-PA storage in intracellular granular structures. Both forskolin and histamine induced regulated release of t-PA.

The effects of nonspecific PKC inhibition (bisindolylmaleimide I; 3 x 10 m) and conventional PKC isoform inhibition (G\u00f67936 10 m) on the acetylcholine dose-response relation were assessed. The expression of conventional PKC isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma), novel PKC isoforms (delta, epsilon, theta), and atypical PKC isoforms (zeta, iota, mu) was measured in PVSM cells by Western blot analysis. The immunofluorescence technique and confocal microscopy were used to localize the cellular distribution of PKC isoforms before and after the addition of acetylcholine.\nAcetylcholine caused dose-dependent contraction in E-pulmonary veins. Pretreatment with bisindolylmaleimide I or G\u00f67936 attenuated acetylcholine contraction. PKC-alpha, -iota, -mu, and -zeta were expressed, whereas PKC-beta, -gamma, -delta, -epsilon;, and -theta were not expressed in PVSM cells. Immunofluorescence staining for PKC isoforms showed that in unstimulated cells, PKC-alpha and PKC-mu were detected only in the cytoplasm. PKC-iota and PKC-zeta also exhibited a cytoplasmic immunofluorescence pattern, which was especially abundant in the perinuclear zone. Activation with acetylcholine induced translocation of PKC-alpha from cytoplasm to membrane, whereas acetylcholine had no effect on the other PKC isoforms. Translocation of PKC-alpha in response to acetylcholine was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine."},{"passage":"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an important risk factor in pediatric population for the early onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

Innovations in biomedical and behavioral interventions may improve reproductive healthcare for HIV-infected women, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, models of integrating HIV and PMTCT services with family planning and reproductive health services will be important to improve reproductive outcomes."},{"passage":"To investigate angiogenesis of the tibial metaphysis in ovariectomized mice with microcomputed tomography, as well as to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the metaphysis, and to explore the relationship between osteoporosis and local blood supply to bones.\nSixty mice were randomly divided into an ovariectomy group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 30). Four weeks after ovariectomy, the mice were killed and the distribution of vessels in the tibial metaphysis was determined after silicone rubber perfusion. In addition, the expression of VEGF of the tibial metaphysis was immunohistochemically determined and bone mineral density, microarchitecture, and biomechanics were tested.\nThe bone mineral density, biomechanical parameters, number of microvessels, and expression of VEGF were significantly reduced in the tibial metaphysis of ovariectomized mice, whose bone microarchitecture was also disrupted."},{"passage":"To test if nicotine counteracts the dampening effect of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of NF-kappaB in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, thereby increasing the permissiveness of RPE cells for HCMV replication.\nHuman ARPE-19 cells were transfected with NF-kappaB luciferase DNA, inoculated with HCMV at 24 hr post-transfection, and maintained in the absence or presence of a physiologic dose of nicotine at 1 hr prior to HCMV inoculation.\nWhereas HCMV-infected ARPE-19 cells without nicotine treatment showed a dramatic decrease in NF-kappaB levels, nicotine treatment reduced this decrease but did not abolish it completely.

The aim was to assess the impact of hyponatremia on admission on long-term mortality of patients with first ever STEMI or non-STEMI (NSTEMI).\nThis was a longitudinal observation study\nThe study population consisted of 3558 patients, aged 25-74 years, with an incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the years 2000-2008 who survived for at least 28 days. All consecutive patients were registered through the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) Myocardial Infarction Registry. Serum sodium levels were obtained on admission. The association with long-term-mortality was examined using Cox regression models.\nHyponatraemia, defined as a sodium level less than 136\u2009mmol\/l, was present in 658 (18.5%) patients on admission. During a median follow-up period of six years (interquartile range (IQR) 4.0-8.2 years), 526 patients (14.8%) died. Hyponatraemia was significantly associated with long-term mortality by an 83% higher risk in the age- and sex-adjusted analysis. After further adjustment for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), glomerular filtration rate, haemoglobin, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, any recanalization therapy, diabetes, medication with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\/angiotensin-receptor blocker before admission and other parameters hyponatraemia remained a strong predictor for higher long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval 1.32-1.97)."},{"passage":"To investigate the possibility of identifying DNA hypermethylation in the circulation of prostate cancer patients.\nPlasma DNA samples were extracted from 36 prostate cancer patients and 27 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) cases. After extensive methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion, the DNA samples were subjected to the real-time quantitative PCR amplification. Dissociation curve analysis was applied to determine if hypermethylation occurred in the promoter region flanking the GSTP1 gene, a well-documented epigenetic event among prostate cancer cells, in these plasma DNA samples.\n11 of 36 prostate cancer patients showed positive peak pattern, indicating methylation changes occurred. Concordant data were obtained from the corresponding paraffin-embedded tissue samples available from the Tumor Bank. Twenty-five of the 27 BPH cases showed negative results, suggesting no methylation changes happened in the CpG islands in these cases."},{"passage":"Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is an inflammatory disorder of the sinonasal mucosa that is frequently associated with microbial colonization. Innate defense mechanisms at the mucosal surface are critical in protecting the host from airborne environmental pathogens. Recent studies of skin and gastrointestinal tract inflammatory diseases have shown that stimulation of the interleukin-22 receptor (IL-22R1) nonspecifically increases innate immune responses. The potential role of IL-22R1 in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP has never been explored.\nProspective.\nNine controls and 19 subjects with CRS were prospectively enrolled prior to undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery. Nasal epithelial cells were cultured from surgically obtained ethmoid mucosa and IL-22R1 protein expression was examined via flow cytometry. RNA was extracted from whole mucosal samples and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to determine expression of IL22 and IL-22R1. Subjects were followed for at least 6 months postoperative to assess for recurrence or persistence of polyps.\nFlow cytometry demonstrated the expression of IL-22R1 protein on the surface of cultured nasal epithelial cells. IL-22R1 mRNA was expressed in 100% of the controls and CRSsNP. However, IL-22R1 was only expressed in 55% of patients with recalcitrant CRSwNP. Additionally, levels of IL22R1 were significantly lower in recalcitrant CRSwNP compared to controls and CRSsNP. IL22 levels did not reach statistical significance."},{"passage":"Mast cells cultured from human peripheral blood have been widely used to study human mast cell function. Prostanoids are the important regulators of mast cell activity, however, there were no reports about the class of prostanoid receptors expressed on such cultured cells.\nThe present study was to characterize pharmacologically the prostanoid receptors by investigating the effects of prostanoid receptor agonists on the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated histamine release from the cultured mast cells.\nMast cells cultured from human progenitor cells in peripheral blood were sensitized with human myeloma IgE, and then challenged with anti-human IgE following pretreatment with diverse prostanoid receptor agonists. The histamine content in supernatants and cell pellets were measured by histamine auto-analyzer.\nOf the prostanoid receptor agonists tested, the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor (EP receptor) agonist PGE2 (10(-7) to 10(-11) M) produced concentration-related potentiation of IgE-mediated histamine release from the cultured mast cells. Sulprostone, an EP1\/EP3 agonist, SC-46275, a selective EP3 agonist, and 11-deoxy-PGE1, a selective EP2\/EP3\/EP4 agonist also caused a significant increase in histamine release induced by anti-IgE. BW245C, fluprostone, cicaprost and U46619 for the prostaglandin D2, F2alpha, I2, and thromboxane A2 receptors respectively, and the EP2\/EP4 receptor agonist butaprost had little effect on anti-IgE stimulated histamine release from mast cells."},{"passage":"To evaluate the accuracy of prediction of intensive care unit length of stay made by physicians at patient admission.\nProspective cohort study.\nThree medical-surgical intensive care units in an oncology hospital.\nAll patients admitted between January and December 2014.\nNone.\nIntensive care unit (ICU) length of stay was estimated by the physicians responsible for patient admission and categorized as <48 h, 2-5 days or more than 5 days. Agreement between predicted and actual intensive care unit length of stay was calculated.\nA total of 2955 patients were admitted during the study period. Physicians accurately predicted ICU length of stay in 1557 (52.7%) admissions. ICU length of stay was underestimated in 864 (29.2%) and overestimated in 534 (18.1%) cases. Agreement between predicted and actual intensive care unit length of stay was poor (Kappa = 0.22) and not associated with physician characteristics.

Despite several existing outcome prediction models for ICH, there are some factors with equivocal value as well as others that still have not been evaluated.\nAll patients with first ever supratentorial ICH presenting to our institution between December 1995 and December 2002 were prospectively enrolled into the study. Patients with historic modified Rankin Scale > 2 and those under anticoagulant treatment or with multiple ICH were excluded. The following parameters were analyzed in 194 consecutive patients: age, gender, past history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, past history of ischemic stroke, presence of ischemic heart disease or cardioembolic disease, current antiplatelet treatment, current alcohol overuse, smoking, Glasgow Coma Scale score (GSS) at admission, volume and location (deep or lobar) of ICH, ventricular extension, glycemia and temperature at admission, and leukoaraiosis. We correlated these data with the 30-day mortality identifying the independent predictors by logistic regression analysis.\nFactors independently associated with 30-day mortality were: age, Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission, ICH volume, ventricular extension, glucose level at admission, and previous antiplatelet use."},{"passage":"To evaluate whether antiinflammatory effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in experimental Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia may be affected by oxygen levels in association with cytokine response and NO synthase (NOS) activity.\nHealthy adult rats were intratracheally instilled with live Klebsiella pneumoniae to induce pneumonia (P) or with sterile saline as a control (C) group. Group C was allocated to room air (CA) and inhaled NO (CNO, NO = 20 parts per million) groups. Group P was divided into 6 groups (n = 8 - 10) exposed to room air (PA), inhaled NO (PNO), low oxygen (40%, PLO), inhaled NO and low oxygen (PLONO), high oxygen (100%, PHO), and inhaled NO and high oxygen (98%, PHONO). After 24 h exposure, intraalveolar cells, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, nuclear transcription factor (NF-kappaB), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NOS activities, characteristic of lung inflammatory mechanisms, were measured.\nAll the pneumonia groups had pneumonia whereas CA and CNO had no or mild lung inflammation. Compared to the PA, significantly decreased recruitment of alveolar neutrophils was found in the PNO, along with lower NF-kappaB and MPO activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Similar trends were found between the PLONO and PLO in alleviation of lung inflammation. However, PHONO significantly enhanced recruitment of alveolar neutrophils and pulmonary MPO activity associated with increased TNF-alpha. Inhaled NO improved bacterial clearance, reduced total proteins in alveoli, and ICAM-1 expression irrespective of oxygen levels. Inhaled NO and\/or low and high oxygen partially restored constitutive NOS activity whereas high oxygen or together with inhaled NO depressed inducible NOS activity."},{"passage":"The Myc-Max heterodimer is a transcription factor that regulates expression of a large number of genes. Genome occupancy of Myc-Max is thought to be driven by Enhancer box (E-box) DNA elements, CACGTG or variants, to which the heterodimer binds in vitro.\nBy analyzing ChIP-Seq datasets, we demonstrate that the positions occupied by Myc-Max across the human genome correlate with the RNA polymerase II, Pol II, transcription machinery significantly better than with E-boxes. Metagene analyses show that in promoter regions, Myc is uniformly positioned about 100 bp upstream of essentially all promoter proximal paused polymerases with Max about 15 bp upstream of Myc. We re-evaluate the DNA binding properties of full length Myc-Max proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results demonstrate Myc-Max heterodimers display significant sequence preference, but have high affinity for any DNA. Quantification of the relative affinities of Myc-Max for all possible 8-mers using universal protein-binding microarray assays shows that sequences surrounding core 6-mers significantly affect binding. Compared to the in vitro sequence preferences,Myc-Max genomic occupancy measured by ChIP-Seq is largely, although not completely, independent of sequence specificity."},{"passage":"Epilepsy is often misdiagnosed and approximately one in every four patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy does not have epilepsy, but instead non-epileptic seizures. Video electroencephalography monitoring (VEM) is the gold standard for differentiation between epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of VEM as a diagnostic tool.\nIn this retrospective study, we have investigated the diagnostic outcome of 155 in patients undergoing VEM at Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet) over a two-year period.\nThe study showed that VEM revealed a diagnosis in 80%. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 38% and epilepsy was rejected in 43% of cases. In the remaining 20% of cases, epilepsy could not be excluded. Among patients who were referred in antiepileptic drug treatment, 29% did not have epilepsy. The highest diagnostic yield was obtained when patients had seizures with ictal electroencephalography paroxysms during VEM."},{"passage":"Less than half of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) achieve sustained viral clearance after pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin therapy. S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) improves interferon signaling in cell culture. We assessed the effect of SAMe on the kinetics of the early antiviral response and interferon signaling in nonresponders to previous antiviral therapy and investigated the mechanisms involved.\nNonresponders with HCV genotype 1 were given peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 2 weeks (course A, baseline\/control). After 1 month, patients received SAMe (1600 mg daily) for 2 weeks and then peginterferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks (course B; completed by 21 of 24 patients). Viral kinetics and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were compared between courses.\nThe decrease in HCV RNA from 0 to 48 hours (phase 1) was similar with and without SAMe. However, the second phase slope of viral decline was improved with SAMe (course A, 0.11 \u00b1 0.04 log(10) IU\/mL\/wk; course B, 0.27 \u00b1 0.06; P = .009); 11 patients (53%) achieved an early virological response, and 10 (48%) had undetectable HCV RNA by week 24. Induction of ISGs in PBMCs was significantly greater during course B. In cultured cells, SAMe increased induction of ISGs and the antiviral effects of interferon by increasing STAT1 methylation, possibly affecting STAT1-DNA binding."},{"passage":"Both peritonitis and serum albumin level are associated with morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Severe cases of peritonitis result in hypoalbuminemia. However, it is not clear whether hypoalbuminemia predicts the development of peritonitis.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database from six centers in western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Incident PD patients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score at the start of PD therapy and serum albumin level measured within 30 days of initiation were selected. Poisson regression was used to analyze predictors of peritonitis.\nThree hundred ninety-three patients had a CCI score and serum albumin level measured at the start of PD therapy. Overall peritonitis rate was 0.65 episodes\/dialysis-year. Significant univariate predictors were albumin level (rate ratio [RR], 0.79 per 1-g\/dL [10-g\/L] increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.95; P = 0.015), male sex (P = 0.003), and being dialyzed in the Veterans Administration (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.62; P < 0.001) or other center (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.92 to 5.62; P < 0.001). Although CCI score correlated inversely with albumin level (r = -0.305; P < 0.001), CCI score was only marginally predictive of peritonitis (P = 0.068). In multivariate analysis, predictors were albumin level (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.75; P = 0.002) and race (RR, 1.36; P = 0.024). Patients with an initial serum albumin level less than 2.9 g\/dL (29 g\/L) had a peritonitis rate of 1.5 episodes\/dialysis-year compared with 0.6 episodes\/dialysis-year for patients with an initial serum albumin level of 2.9 g\/dL or greater (P < 0.001)."},{"passage":"Previous studies show that the rise in skin blood flow and cutaneous vascular conductance during heat stress is substantially attenuated in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. The mechanisms responsible for this finding are not clear. In particular, little is known regarding the responses of skin sympathetic nerve activity (SSNA) that control the skin blood flow during heat stress in CHF patients. We examined the effects of a modest heat stress to test the hypothesis that SSNA responses could be attenuated in CHF.\nWe assessed SSNA (microneurography) from the peroneal nerve and skin blood flow (forearm laser Doppler) in 9 patients with stable class II-III CHF and in matched healthy subjects during passive whole-body heating with a water-perfused suit. Whole-body heating induced similar increases in internal temperature (\u22480.6 \u00b0C) in both groups.

In this study, we investigated a new physiologic approach that consists of coinjecting motogenic factors insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to enhance the migration of human skeletal myoblasts. Among the different ways by which those factors can induce the cell migration processes, we investigated their capacity to enhance cell endogenous proteolytic activity that will help transplanted cells to migrate through the extracellular matrix.\nIn vitro, myoblasts were coincubated with bFGF or IGF-1. Growth factors effects on cell migration were evaluated using invasion chambers, and their effects on proteolytic systems were evaluated by zymography, Western blot, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, myoblasts were coinjected with growth factors and the intramuscular migration capacity was assessed using the microtube technique.\nIn vitro, the presence of IGF-1 or bFGF significantly enhanced the expression of the gelatinase matrix metalloproteinase-9 and focalized the fibrinolytic system activity at the cell membrane. In vitro and in vivo, both bFGF and IGF-1 showed strong chemokinetic potentials and improved the migration of human myoblasts.

Four missense TBX5 mutations, p.R355C, p.Q376R, p.A428S, and p.S372L, were identified in evolutionarily conserved regions. We did not find any mutations in CAV1, KCNJ2, KCNQ1, NKX2.5, and PITX2. These mutations increased the expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and connexin-40 (CX40) in the primarily cultured rat atrial myocytes but did not alter the expression of cardiac structural genes, atrial myosin heavy chain-\u03b1 (MHC-\u03b1) and myosin light chain-2\u03b1 (MLC-2\u03b1). Overexpression of p.R355C developed an atrial arrhythmia suggestive of paroxysmal AF in the zebrafish model. To replicate our findings, we screened TBX5 in 527 early-onset AF cases from the Massachusetts General Hospital AF study.

Although recipient genetics may contribute to responder and\/or nonresponder status, in most cases HLA type does not predict humoral response to RBC antigens. In contrast, rates of alloimmunization do correspond to the underlying disease status of transfusion recipients, suggesting that acquired host factors may play an important role. In this context, it was hypothesized that the inflammatory status of a transfusion recipient would influence immunization to transfused RBCs.\nA novel murine model for alloimmunization to RBC antigens was developed with the mHEL mouse, which expresses hen egg lysozyme (HEL) as a model blood group antigen. Leukoreduced mHEL RBCs were transfused into wild-type recipient mice, and anti-HEL responses were monitored. To test the stated hypothesis, some recipient animals were injected with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic double-stranded RNA molecule that induces viral-like inflammation.\nSimilar to the immunogenicity of most RBC antigens in humans, transfusion of mHEL RBCs into uninflamed mice was only a weak immunogen.

Knockdown of \u03b3-secretase was achieved using siRNA.\n\u03b3-Secretase upregulation and PS1 overexpression suppressed VEGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis and in vivo laser-induced CNV. This was associated with a reduction in the expression of VEGF and angiogenin 1 together with reduced superoxide anion generation and an increase in MnSOD compared with untreated CNV eyes.

We aimed to determine if a carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) plays a role in the transcriptional up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and the downstream VEGF expression in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exposed to high glucose under normoxic conditions.\nARPE19 cells were exposed to 5.6, 11, 17, 25 and 30 mM glucose for 48 h in serum-free culture media under normoxic (21\u2009% O2) conditions. Protein and mRNA expression of indicated genes were determined by immunoblot analyses and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the concentrations of VEGF in the media. Immunofluorescence (IF) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for ChREBP were used to demonstrate nuclear translocation and HIF-1\u03b1 gene promoter association, respectively.\nImmunoblot analyses showed that HIF-1\u03b1 levels were positively related to levels of glucose exposure between 5.6-25 mM in the RPE cells, indicating the induction and stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 by elevated glucose under normoxic conditions. Human lens epithelial cells and HeLa cells did not respond to high glucose, implying that this phenomenon is cell type-specific. Real-time RT-PCR for HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF and ELISA for VEGF indicated that high glucose is associated with elevated production of HIF-1\u03b1-induced VEGF, an established inducer of neovascularization, in the RPE cells. IF analyses showed that, although ChREBP was expressed under both low (5.6 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose conditions, it appeared more in the nuclear region than in the cytosol of the RPE cells after the high glucose treatment. ChIP analyses suggested a HIF-1\u03b1 gene promoter association with ChREBP under the high glucose condition. These results imply that RPE cells use cytosolic ChREBP as a glucose sensor to up-regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression."},{"passage":"Accurate calculations of testicular volume standard deviation (SD) scores are not currently available. We constructed LMS-smoothed age-reference charts for testicular volume in healthy boys.\nThe LMS method was used to calculate reference data, based on testicular volumes from ultrasonography and Prader orchidometer of 769 healthy Dutch boys aged 6 months to 19 years. We also explored the association between testicular growth and pubic hair development, and data were compared to orchidometric testicular volumes from the 1997 Dutch nationwide growth study.\nThe LMS-smoothed reference charts showed that no revision of the definition of normal onset of male puberty - from nine to 14 years of age - was warranted.

Glomerular expression of nephrin, podocin and synaptopodin was studied in renal biopsies by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Correlation of expression with clinical and biochemical parameters was performed.\nThe pattern of expression for all podocyte proteins in controls was uniform fine granular along the capillary walls towards the visceral epithelial cell aspect. Glomerular expression of nephrin was present in all renal biopsies and was similar to that in controls. Glomerular synaptopodin expression was seen in all MN and MPGN patients, while it was seen in 74\u00a0% (17\/23) MCD and 93.5\u00a0% (29\/31) FSGS.

Ca2+ mobilization was measured with fluorescence spectrophotometry using the Ca2+ binding dye Fura\/2AM.\nIn the absence of HA, cisplatin inhibited tumor cell growth. The addition of HA, but not HA plus anti-CD44 antibody, resulted in a 5-fold reduced ability of cisplatin to cause HNSCC cell death, suggesting that HA can promote CD44-dependent cisplatin resistance. Fluorescence spectrophotometry demonstrated that HA can promote CD44-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in HNSCC. On the other hand, the presence of U73122, a PLC inhibitor, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor inhibitor, eliminated HA-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and HA-mediated cisplatin resistance in these cell lines."},{"passage":"The combination of \u03b2-blockers and band ligation is the standard approach to prevent variceal rebleeding, but bleeding recurs and mortality is high.

Despite its frequent association with atherosclerosis, compelling studies have shown striking differences and potentially opposite roles of T-cell helper responses in aneurysm as compared with atherosclerosis, casting doubt on the relevance and suitability of T-cell-targeted therapies in this context.\nHere, we show that selective depletion of T regulatory (Treg) cells using a CD25-specific monoclonal antibody significantly enhances the susceptibility of C57Bl\/6 mice to angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm and promotes aortic rupture (n=25-44 mice\/group). Similar results are observed in angiotensin II-treated Cd80(-\/-)\/Cd86(-\/-) or Cd28(-\/-) mice with impaired Treg cell homeostasis (n=18-23 mice\/group). Treg cell depletion is associated with increased immune cell activation and a blunted interleukin (IL)-10 anti-inflammatory response, suggesting an immunoinflammatory imbalance. Interestingly, Il-10(-\/-) mice (n=20 mice\/group) show increased susceptibility to angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortic rupture and are insensitive to Treg cell depletion. Finally, reconstitution of Cd28(-\/-) Treg-deficient mice with Treg cells (n=22 mice\/group) restores a balance in the immunoinflammatory response, rescues the animals from increased susceptibility to aneurysm, and prevents aortic dissection."},{"passage":"Giardia duodenalis is a common protozoan parasite of humans and animals.

Upper- and lower-extremity transcranial motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded during four defined periods: baseline without dexmedetomidine; two periods with dexmedetomidine (0.3 and 0.6 ng\/ml), in a randomly determined order; and a final period 1 h after drug discontinuation. The primary outcomes were amplitude and latency of P37\/N20, and amplitude, area under the curve, and voltage threshold for transcranial motor evoked potential stimulation.\nOf the total, data from 30 patients were evaluated. Use of dexmedetomidine, as an anesthetic adjunct, did not have an effect on the latency or amplitude of sensory evoked potentials greater than was prespecified as clinically relevant, and though the authors were unable to claim equivalence on the amplitude of transcranial motor evoked responses due to variability, recordings were made throughout the study in all patients."},{"passage":"The use of 'hinged' knee prostheses for primary knee arthroplasty procedures is increasing.

To find out whether anti-proliferation and cell death were associated with apoptosis, we used flow cytometry to quantify the extent of apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay to measures DNA degradation of apoptotic cells. The proteins involved in the 13-MTD induced apoptosis were examined using Western blot.\nWe show that 13-MTD inhibits cellular proliferation and viability in human bladder cancer cells, which has been attributed to apoptosis. 13-MTD down-regulates Bcl-2 and up-regulates Bax. This promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, as well as the proteolytic activation of caspases. Moreover, 13-MTD down-regulates AKT phosphorylation and activates phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

The injury was caused by flame (14 cases, 18 parts), electricity (4 cases, 5 parts), and hot water (1 case, 1 part). The unstable burn scars located on hands (8 cases), forearms (2 cases), thighs (3 cases), legs (2 cases), feet (2 cases), chest (1 case), and abdomen (1 case). Scar formed for 3 months to 1 year. The area of defect varied from 7 cm x 5 cm to 22 cm x 15 cm after scar removal. Defects were covered with acellular allogeneic dermal matrix and autogenous split-thickness skin graft. At 6-18 months after operation, the pathological observations of the epidermis, the basal membrane, and structural components of the dermis were done.\nAll wounds healed by first intention. Scar ulcer disappeared completely in 18 cases and the composite skin grafts all survived. Some blisters occurred in 1 case and were cured after dressing changing. All patients were followed up 10 months to 2 years (18 months on average). The grafted-skin was excellent in the appearance, texture, and elasticity. The function recovered well.

Also, antibody competition, affinity chromatography, and potassium thiocyanate extraction studies were undertaken.\nTissue transglutaminase antibody binding patterns were identical with the extracellular binding patterns seen with celiac patient sera. Human umbilical cord-derived fibroblasts exhibited both cytoplasmic and extracellular matrix staining. Double staining with patients' sera and tissue transglutaminase antibodies showed complete overlapping. Tissue transglutaminase effectively absorbed reticulin-endomysial antibodies from celiac sera, and patients' sera blocked the staining of the monoclonal tissue transglutaminase antibodies.

In these processes the signaling function of PAPC in activating RhoA\/JNK and supporting Wnt-11\/PCP by binding to frizzled 7 (fz7) is important.\nHere we demonstrate by loss of function experiments in Xenopus embryos that PAPC regulates another type of morphogenetic movement, the invagination of the ear placode. Knockdown of PAPC by antisense morpholinos results in deformation of the otic vesicle without altering otocyst marker expression. Depletion of PAPC could be rescued by full-length PAPC, constitutive active RhoA and by the closely related PCNS but not by classical cadherins. Also the cytoplasmic deletion mutant M-PAPC, which influences cell adhesion, does not rescue the PAPC knockdown.

However, the in vivo functions and mechanisms by which these proteins act are poorly understood.\nWe have used biochemical and genetic approaches to study the role of a Smyd protein in Drosophila. We identified eleven Drosophila genes that encode Smyd proteins. CG14122 encodes a Smyd4 homologue that we have named dSmyd4. dSmyd4 repressed transcription and recruited class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). A region of dSmyd4 including the MYND domain interacted directly with approximately 150 amino acids at the N-termini of dHDAC1 and dHDAC3. dSmyd4 interacts selectively with Ebi, a component of the dHDAC3\/SMRTER co-repressor complex. During embryogenesis dSmyd4 was expressed throughout the mesoderm, with highest levels in the somatic musculature. Muscle-specific RNAi against dSmyd4 resulted in depletion of the protein and lead to severe lethality. Eclosion is the final moulting stage of Drosophila development when adult flies escape from the pupal case. 80% of dSmyd4 knockdown flies were not able to eclose, resulting in late pupal lethality. However, many aspects of eclosion were still able to occur normally, indicating that dSmyd4 is likely to be involved in the development or function of adult muscle."},{"passage":"In Parkinson\u203as disease (PD) prolong use of L-DOPA causes some motor disorders such as wearing-off and L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID).

Th e cell block sections were evaluated for the presence of single tumor cells, acinary or papillary pattern, solid islands and staining with mucicarmine.\nThere were 20 patients each in the benign and malignant conventional smear group. In the benign group, adding the cell block method to conventional smear provided a diagnosis of malignancy in 4 more patients and the diagnosis of malignant effusion was increased by a ratio of 10% (4\/40). In the malignant group, adding the cell block technique provided the subtyping of lung cancer as adenocarcinoma in 7 patients (7\/20, 35%)."},{"passage":"c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, invasion, metastases, and angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of c-Met in melanoma biology using a novel small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU11274 and small interfering (si) RNA against the receptor.\nThe effects of SU11274 and c-Met siRNA were studied on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, reactive oxygen species, and intracellular signaling. c-Met mutations were examined, and the expression of c-Met and activated c-Met was studied in nevi, primary, and metastatic melanoma.\nc-Met was expressed in 6:7 melanoma cell lines by immunoblotting. SU11274 inhibited cell growth in all melanoma cell lines by 85% to 98% with an IC(50) between 1 and 2.5 mumol\/L and caused apoptosis (12-58%) in five out of six cell lines. siRNA against c-Met inhibited proliferation of melanoma cells by 60%. This is the first study that shows that SU11274 and siRNA induced microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and several other melanoma differentiation proteins and a morphologically differentiated phenotype. SU11274 also inhibited reactive oxygen species formation and phosphorylation of c-Met receptor, AKT and S-6 kinase by the hepatocyte growth factor. A new missense c-Met mutation N948S was identified in cell lines and R988C in tumor tissue in the juxtamembrane domain of c-Met.

Both times they took paracetamol (1.5 g together with a standardized breakfast) and drank ethanol (0.3 g\/kg) 1 h after eating breakfast. On one drinking occasion, no previous medication was given. The other alcohol session was performed after the subjects had taken 75 mg ASA once daily for 7 days. On both occasions, venous blood samples were obtained at exactly timed intervals for a period of 3.5 h.\nThe blood-ethanol profiles showed large interindividual variations for both experiments. After treatment with ASA, the maximum blood-ethanol concentration was distinctly lower in seven subjects, almost unchanged in two subjects and increased in one subject. Overall, a statistically significant decrease in the peak blood-ethanol concentration was observed. The time required to reach peak blood-ethanol levels was somewhat longer after treatment with ASA. Although the areas under the concentration-time profiles were smaller after ASA treatment, these differences were not statistically significant. The concentrations of paracetamol in plasma were lower when ethanol was ingested after treatment with ASA and the areas under the concentration-time curves (0-170 min) were smaller."},{"passage":"Inducible chitinase 3-like-1 is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and adheres to bacteria under conditions of inflammation.

We investigated the effects of infecting different IEC lines with these bacteria compared with nonpathogenic E coli; chitinase activities were measured using the colloidal chitin-azure method. Colitis was induced in C57\/Bl6 mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate, and mice were given 10(8) bacteria for 15 consecutive days by gavage. Stool\/tissue samples were collected and analyzed.\nLF82-\u0394chiA had significantly less adhesion to IEC lines than LF82. Complementation of LF82-\u0394chiA with the LF82 chiA gene, but not chiA from nonpathogenic (K12) E coli, increased adhesion. We identified 5 specific polymorphisms in the chitin-binding domain of LF82 chiA (at amino acids 362, 370, 378, 388, and 548) that differ from chiA of K12 and were required for LF82 to interact directly with IECs. This interaction was mediated by an N-glycosylated asparagine in chitinase 3-like-1 (amino acid 68) on IECs. Mice infected with LF82, or LF82-\u0394chiA complemented with LF82 chiA, developed more severe colitis after administration of dextran sodium sulfate than mice infected with LF82-\u0394chiA or LF82 that expressed mutant forms of chiA."},{"passage":"Transforming growth factor beta is recognized as a major cytokine in extracellular matrix (ECM) pathobiology as occurs in diabetic nephropathy.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that L-carnosine inhibits TGF-\u03b2 production and signalling, thereby reducing hyperglycaemia-associated ECM accumulation.\nHuman mesangial cells (MC) were cultured in high-glucose (HG, 25 mM D-glucose) medium alone or in HG medium to which 20 mM L-carnosine was added. Collagen VI (Col6) and fibronectin (FN) deposition and messenger RNA expression were studied. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 production and activation of Smad1\/5\/8 (ALK1) and Smad2\/3 (ALK5) pathways were assessed.\nUnder HG conditions, deposition of Col6 and FN were increased 1.4- and 1.6-fold. This was significantly inhibited on the protein and messenger RNA level by L-carnosine. TGF-\u03b2 production increased under HG conditions but was completely normalized by addition of L-carnosine. Addition of exogenous TGF-\u03b2 could not overcome the effect of L-carnosine on Col6 and FN expression, indicating additionally interference with TGF-\u03b2 downstream signalling. Along the same line, L-carnosine reduced TGF-\u03b2-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation, suggesting an inhibitory effect on ALK5 signalling. ALK1 signalling remained unchanged.

Due to long-term irrigation use in agricultural systems, soil salinity is increasing; consequently crop yield is adversely affected. It is known that salt tolerance is a quantitative trait supported by genes affecting ion homeostasis, ion transport, ion compartmentalization and ion selectivity. Less is known about pathways connecting NaCl and cell proliferation and cell death. Plant growth and cell proliferation is, in part, controlled by the concerted activity of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex with glucose. Prompted by the abundance of stress-related, functional annotations of genes encoding proteins that interact with core components of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex (AtRGS1, AtGPA1, AGB1, and AGG), we tested the hypothesis that G proteins modulate plant growth under salt stress.\nNa+ activates G signaling as quantitated by internalization of Arabidopsis Regulator of G Signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1). Despite being components of a singular signaling complex loss of the G\u03b2 subunit (agb1-2 mutant) conferred accelerated senescence and aborted development in the presence of Na+, whereas loss of AtRGS1 (rgs1-2 mutant) conferred Na+ tolerance evident as less attenuated shoot growth and senescence. Site-directed changes in the G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 protein-protein interface were made to disrupt the interaction between the G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits in order to elevate free activated G\u03b1 subunit and free G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer at the plasma membrane.

It has been found prevalent also in many other parts of China since 1955, and presently, 28 out of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, or municipalities) have been proved to be its endemic areas. The total number of cases is 1,256,431 from 1950 to 1997, with 44,304 death (3.53%). 50-100 thousands of cases could be registered annually since 1981 when the presence of the Rattus-type HFRS was first identified serologically in China, with the highest peak in 1986 (115,985 cases). Three types of endemicity have been differentiated: the Apodemus-type, the Rattus-type and the mixed type of the two, by their peculiar seasonal distributions of cases and by methods of serotyping (HI, MAbs serotyping kits). The epidemiologic features of the Rattus-type HFRS are quite different from that of the Apodemus-type. 67 species of vertebrates were found to harbor hantavirus antigen or antibodies, but the chief or primary reservoir hosts are Apodemus agrarius and Rattus norvegicus only. Besides the commonly recognized enzootic mode of transmission (via contacts with the reservoir rodents or their excreta), mite transmission (including certain species of gamasid mites, and chigger mites) has been identified as the potential vectors and reservoir hosts with HFRS. Vertical transmission had been found in pregnant patients with HFRS, and in all three chief host rodents (Apodemus agrarius, Rattus norvegicus, the laboratory rats). The relatively high inapparent infection rates in the population of endemic areas of the Rattus-type HFRS after big outbreaks (8%-20%) are suggested to play a significant role in the gradual decline of the incidence of HFRS in that areas. Three kinds of inactivated vaccines against HFRS (the golden hamster kidney cell vaccine, the Mongolian gerbil kidney cell vaccine and the purified suckling mouse brain vaccine) have been successively developed and proved highly effective in the prevention of HFRS."},{"passage":"To compare two treatment strategies in preterm infants with or at risk of respiratory distress syndrome: early surfactant administration (within one hour of birth) versus late surfactant administration, in a geographically defined population.\nThe primary outcome was chronic lung disease (CLD) and mortality before\/at 36 weeks.

The standard protocol comprised STIR and T1w sequences. All patients who showed typical signs of bone metastases were included in the study. Evaluation of the images was performed by the calculation of the number of metastases by three independent readers and by visual assessment on a 4-point scale.\n86 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The total number of metastases was significantly higher on T1w than on STIR images at both field strengths (p<0.05). T1w revealed a sensitivity of 99.72% (3 T) and 100.00% (1.5 T) versus STIR with 70.99 % (3 T) and 79.34 % (1.5 T). In 53% (38\/72) of all patients, STIR detected fewer bone metastases in comparison with T1w at 3\u200aT. At 1.5 T, STIR showed inferior results in 37.5 % (18\/48) of all patients. Qualitative analysis indicated a significantly better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation and an improved image quality on T1w compared to STIR imaging at both field strengths (p<0.05) with similar results for T1w at 1.5 T and 3 T, but inferior results for STIR especially at 3 T."},{"passage":"A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.\nA Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.\nSix completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter.

However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception.\nTwo speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment.\nAt 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients.

Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.\nAll the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures.

To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships.\nA total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05)."},{"passage":"Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear.\nTo correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI).\nWe collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK.\n204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value<0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value<0.001).

Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar."},{"passage":"Patients transported by helicopter often require advanced airway management.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.\nThe following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging.

Inclusion criteria were being in treatment with s.c. anti-TNF agents and having had neither changes in therapy nor local corticosteroid injections in the previous 3 months. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory [28-joint DAS (DAS28) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)]and US assessment at two time points, i.e. at peak plasma drug concentration and at trough plasma drug concentration. US assessments were performed blindly to the anti-TNF agent, the administration time and the clinical and laboratory data. Twenty-eight joints were investigated for the presence and grade (0-3) of B-mode synovitis and synovial power Doppler signal. Global indices for B-mode synovitis (BSI) and Doppler synovitis (DSI) were calculated for 12 joints and for wrist-hand-ankle-foot joints. B-mode US remission was defined as a BSI<1 and Doppler US remission as a DSI<1.\nThere were no significant differences between the clinical, laboratory and B-mode and Doppler US parameters at peak time and trough time (P = 0.132-0.986). There were no significant differences between the proportion of patients with active disease and those in remission according to DAS28, SDAI, B-mode US and Doppler US at peak time and trough time assessments (P = 0.070-1)."},{"passage":"A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. Such a case has never been reported.\nA 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit."},{"passage":"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform.\nA unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables.\nEmpirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."},{"passage":"Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus \/AIDS (HIV\/AIDS) patients.\nThis is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy.\nThe Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV\/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV\/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49\/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images.\nUsing scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant.\nTwo hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined. For the fibular head, the mean difference between the treated and the control knee was 0.0 mm with narrow confidence limits ranging from -1.1 to 1.1."},{"passage":"Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is classified in DSM-III-R as a nonpsychotic somatoform disorder, controversy exists as to whether BDD can present with psychotic features. If it can, this raises the possibility that its DSM-III-R psychotic counterpart-delusional disorder, somatic type--may not be a separate disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity).\nFifty consecutive patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria A and C for BDD were assessed with a semistructured interview and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Family histories of psychiatric disorders were blindly assessed. The 24 patients with nonpsychotic BDD were compared with the 26 patients with psychotic BDD with respect to demographics, phenomenology, course of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, and treatment response.\nPatients with psychotic BDD displayed a significantly higher rate of lifetime DSM-III-R psychotic disorder diagnoses than patients with nonpsychotic BDD. However, the two groups did not differ significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics."},{"passage":"Governments are urged to determine methods to control the use of medical resources and curb the rise of healthcare costs. The question is, do health behaviors have an impact on the use of medical resources? This study aims to identify and understand the difference in the number of outpatient visits and health examinations based on various health behaviors and to determine whether patients seek medical care for illness from the same physicians.\nThis study used the dataset derived from the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 2005. Persons older than 15\u00a0years were surveyed using an on-site questionnaire. A total of 2911 persons were enrolled in this study. Independent t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, multiple linear regression and binominal logistic regression were used in the data analysis.\nThe regression model for the frequency of doctor visits, health examinations, and whether the same physician is sought for medical care has demonstrated significant correlations with gender, age and education-level variables. Four health behaviors (i.e., exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, drinking habits) exhibited a significant correlation with healthcare utilization (P<0.05)."},{"passage":"The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the hemodynamic performance of the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses in the aortic position, and to evaluate prosthesis-specific differences in valve sizing and valve-size labeling.\nBetween August 2000 and September 2002, 139 patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the Mosaic (n = 67) or Perimount (n = 72) bioprosthesis. Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively.\nOperative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 Mosaic valves. The EOA ranged from 0.78 to 2.37 cm2 in Mosaic patients, and from 0.95 to 2.12 cm2 in Perimount patients. When indexing EOA by calculating the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area to adjust for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions, there was no significant difference between the two bioprostheses."},{"passage":"The morbidity and mortality associated with Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL)-positive Staphylococcus aureus suggest that this toxin is a key marker of disease severity. Nevertheless, the importance of PVL in the pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus is uncertain.

PVL-positive isolates were characterized by toxin gene profiling, PFGE, spa-typing and MIC determinations for a range of antimicrobials.\nFour out of 244 isolates (1.6%) were PVL-positive and susceptible to oxacillin [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)]. Eighty-eight out of 244 (36%) were oxacillin-resistant (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), but none was PVL-positive. The four patients (two males: 30 and 33 years; two females: 62 and 80 years) had infection foci of: skin and soft tissue, unknown, indwelling line, and surgical site, and were located at one centre in Wales, one in England and two in Ireland. One of four PVL-positive isolates was resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid, the remainder were susceptible to all antibiotics tested.

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible.\nFifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +\/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg\/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.\nOf the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +\/- 15% to 57 +\/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients.

A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary.\nOutcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000.

In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes.\nWe used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded.\nWhen initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald&Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska,&Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists.

The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

The patients were evaluated 3 months after lithotripsy with a simple abdominal X-ray and a kidney ultrasound scan. The success of the treatment, removal of all fragments, was correlated with renal anatomical factors measured in the pre-treatment intravenous urography: infundibulopelvic angle, lower infundibulum width, lower infundibulum length, ratio length\/width, infundibulum height, and number of minor calyces in the lower calyceal group.\nThree months after SWL treatment, 39 patients were stone-free (NR group) and 39 had residual fragments (R group). Both groups presented no differences in relation to infundibulopelvic angle, width and length of the lower calyceal infundibulum, length\/width ratio of the lower infundibulum or number of lower calyces.

The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%."},{"passage":"Desmopressin releases tissue-type plasminogen activator, which augments cardiopulmonary bypass--associated hyperfibrinolysis, causing excessive bleeding.

(ii) To test the hypothesis that this relationship could be explained by: (a) reporting of psychological factors, (b) common association of self-reported mechanical factors with other unexplained syndromes.\nA population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes.\nAn adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.6)."},{"passage":"Electronic health records have the potential to facilitate family history use by primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide personalized care.

Medical records of a cohort of community-based primary care patients, aged 35 to 65 years, who previously participated in our Family Healthware study and had a moderate or strong familial risk for any of the 6 diseases were subsequently reviewed. The main outcome measures were PCP response to the prompts, adding family history risk to problem summary lists, and patient screening status for each disease.\nThe 492 eligible patients had 847 visits during the study period; 152 visits had no documentation of response to a family history prompt. Of the remaining 695 visits, physician responses were reviewed family history (n = 372, 53.5%), discussed family history (n = 159, 22.9%), not addressed (n = 155, 22.3%), and reviewed family history and ordered tests\/referrals (n = 5, 0.7%).

Cases were women aged 65 and older with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed breast cancer. Controls were aged 65 and older without clinical cancer who were seen at the same hospital.\nWe obtained data on 190 white cases and 172 white controls. Primary hyperparathyroidism (an abnormally high calcium level confirmed by an abnormally high serum PTH) was found in 3\/190 cases and in 0\/172 controls (p = 0.25).

To compare effects of platelets at different degrees of their activation, FMLP (selective PMNL stimulus) and Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (activates both PMNL and platelets) were used as chemiluminescence stimuli. The liberation of serotonin from platelets was estimated fluorometrically.\nBoth stimulated and non-stimulated platelets inhibited PMNL chemiluminescence. However, while the decreasing effect of resting platelets disappeared at increased extracellular peroxidase concentration, the inhibition of chemiluminescence by activated platelets became even more pronounced after the addition of peroxidase and was accompanied by liberation of serotonin.

Of the men who completed the questionnaire 2,499 were living in a partnership and formed the study group for this survey. Based on the IIEF-6, two study endpoints (SEP) were defined (point values \u2264 25\/SEP1 and \u2264 21\/SEP2). By multivariable logistic regression analysis the independent influence of previous circumcision on both endpoints was assessed.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) was present in 40.1 % of men based on SEP1 (minor to severe ED) and in 27.8 % based on SEP2 (moderate to severe ED). Based on SEP1 as well as SEP2 age, history of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chronic ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial obstructive disease, cirrhosis of the liver and history of pelvic surgery were found to have an independent influence on the presence of ED. A status after circumcision did not show an independent influence on either study endpoints (SEP1: OR 1.36, p=0.174; SEP2: OR 1.42, p=0.175).

We hypothesized that heterogeneous sympathetic denervation with phenol would create a milieu for sustained AF.\nAfter the determination of baseline inducibility, 15 dogs underwent atrial epicardial phenol application and 11 underwent a sham procedure. After 2 weeks of recovery, the animals had repeat attempts at inducing AF and effective refractory period (ERP) testing. Epicardial maps were obtained to determine local AF cycle lengths. ERPs were determined at baseline and during sympathetic, vagal, and simultaneous vagal\/sympathetic stimulation. Dogs then underwent PET imaging with either a sympathetic ([11C]hydroxyephedrine, HED) or parasympathetic (5-[11C]methoxybenzovesamicol, MOBV) nerve label. None of the animals had sustained AF (>60 minutes) at baseline. None of the sham dogs and 14 of 15 phenol dogs had sustained AF at follow-up. Sites to which phenol was applied had a significantly shorter ERP (136+\/-17.6 ms) than those same sites in the sham controls (156+\/-19.1 ms) (P=0.01). Although there was no difference in the ERP change with either vagal or sympathetic stimulation alone between phenol and nonphenol sites, the percent decrease in ERP with simultaneous vagal\/sympathetic stimulation was greater in the phenol sites (17+\/-8%) than in the nonphenol sites (9+\/-9%) (P=0.01). There was a significantly increased dispersion of refractoriness (21+\/-6.4 ms in the sham versus 58+\/-14 ms in the phenol dogs, P=0.01) as well as dispersion of AF cycle length (49+\/-10 ms in the sham versus 105+\/-12 ms in the phenol dogs, P=0.0001).

Measurements included refraction, keratometry, and A-scan values for axial length, lens thickness, lens position, anterior chamber depth, anterior segment depth, and lens power calculations. Comparisons were also made with published age-matched, full-term normal controls.\nRefractions ranged from a spherical-equivalent of -5.0 to -20.75, and from -5.0 to -22.0 diopters in ROP and full-term eyes, respectively. For ROP eyes, increasing myopia was most associated with lens thickness and lens power ( P < 0.001), with lesser contributions from corneal steepness, axial length, and a more forward position of the lens's center. For the eyes with myopia in full-term patients, increasing myopia was highly associated with axial length ( P < 0.001), with smaller contributions from increased lens thickness and lens power.

Data on neonatal outcomes for infants with IUGR at each viable gestational age at birth from large numbers of deliveries are lacking. More particularly, data on perinatal outcome related to an antenatal diagnosis of IUGR compared with a neonatal diagnosis are particularly deficient. Therefore, by using a large contemporary database, we evaluated the outcomes of neonates with IUGR and the gestational age-specific associations between growth restriction, morbidity, and mortality.\nWith the use of a database formed from a computer-assisted tool that generates clinical progress notes and discharge summaries on neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, we reviewed data on neonates discharged from 124 NICUs between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2001. We evaluated singleton, inborn neonates who delivered between 23 and 34 weeks, excluding major congenital anomalies. We compared 3 measures of IUGR: antenatally diagnosed IUGR; a birth weight below the 10th percentile (small for gestational age [SGA]), and newborn infants with either or both of these diagnoses against a control group of gestational age-matched infants meeting none of these criteria whose birth weights were no greater than the 90th percentile.\nOur sample included 29,916 prematurely born neonates; 1,451 (4.8%) with IUGR, 2,936 (9.8%) who were SGA, and 3,708 (12.3%) had at least 1 of these 2 markers. There were 22,798 (76%) normally grown control neonates. Within each gestational age group from 25 to 32 weeks, each marker of IUGR was associated with increased mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, need for respiratory support at 28 days of age, and retinopathy of the premature. When corrected for gestational age, exposure to antenatal steroids, gender, and mode of delivery, these associations remained significant."},{"passage":"Early life nutrition is critical for the development of hypothalamic neurons involved in energy homeostasis. We previously showed that intrauterine and early postnatal overnutrition programmed hypothalamic neurons expressing the appetite stimulator neuropeptide Y (NPY) and suppressor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in offspring at weaning. However, the long-term effects of such programming and its interactions with post-weaning high-fat-diet (HFD) consumption are unclear.\nFemale Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to chow or HFD for 5 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. On postnatal day 1, litters were adjusted to 3\/litter to induce postnatal overnutrition (vs. 12 in control). At postnatal day 20, half of the rats from each maternal group were weaned onto chow or HFD for 15 weeks. Hypothalamic appetite regulators, and fuel (glucose and lipid) metabolic markers were measured.\nOffspring from obese dams gained more weight than those from lean dams independent of post-weaning diet. Maternal obesity interacted with post-weaning HFD consumption to cause greater levels of hyperphagia, adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and glucose intolerance in offspring. This was linked to increased hypothalamic NPY signaling and leptin resistance in adult offspring. Litter size reduction had a detrimental impact on insulin and adiponectin, while hypothalamic NPY and POMC mRNA expression were suppressed in the face of normal energy intake and weight gain."},{"passage":"Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders treated with tricyclic antidepressants sometimes report nongastrointestinal symptoms; it is unclear whether these are drug side effects or reflect a behavioral tendency to report symptoms.

It was observed that bortezomib-induced apoptotic death is correlated with FGFR3 expression. U937 cells overexpression of wild-type FGFR3 demonstrated resistance to bortezomib treatment. U937 cells expressing Y373C mutated FGFR3 showed an almost equal resistance to bortezomib as U937 cells expressing wild-type FGFR3. U937 cells expressing mutated K650E FGFR3 showed more sensitivity to bortezomib than did the parental U937 cells. Furthermore, increased expression of Mcl-1 and decreased expression of NF-kappaB p65 suggested that bortezomib resistance associated with Y373C mutation and wild-type FGFR3 may be partly mediated through Bcl-2 and NF-kappaB signaling."},{"passage":"Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery.

Frailty was defined as any impairment in activities of daily living (Katz index), ambulation, or a documented history of dementia. Of 3826 patients, 157 (4.1%) were frail. Frail patients were older, were more likely to be female, and had risk factors for adverse surgical outcomes. By logistic regression, frailty was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0), as well as institutional discharge (odds ratio 6.3, 95% CI 4.2 to 9.4).

However, the NO moiety gives these hybrids potential for actions further to their aspirin-mediated anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory effects. Having previously shown that novel NO-aspirin hybrids containing a furoxan NO-releasing group have potent anti-platelet effects, here we investigate their anti-inflammatory properties. Here we examine their effects upon TNFalpha release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages and investigate a potential mechanism of action through effects on LPS-stimulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation.\nPeripheral venous blood was drawn from the antecubital fossa of human volunteers. Mononuclear cells were isolated and cultured. The resultant differentiated macrophages were treated with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of either a furoxan-aspirin (B8, B7; 10 muM), their respective furazan NO-free counterparts (B16, B15; 10 muM), aspirin (10 muM), existing nitroaspirin (NCX4016; 10 muM), an NO donor (DEA\/NO; 10 muM) or dexamethasone (1 muM), in the presence and absence of LPS (10 ng\/ml; 4 h). Parallel experiments were conducted on undifferentiated fresh monocytes. Supernatants were assessed by specific ELISA for TNFalpha release and by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay for cell necrosis. To assess NF-kappaB activation, the effects of the compounds on the loss of cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha (assessed by western blotting) and nuclear localisation (assessed by immunofluorescence) of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB were determined.\nB8 significantly reduced TNFalpha release from LPS-treated macrophages to 36 +\/- 10% of the LPS control. B8 and B16 significantly inhibited monocyte TNFalpha release to 28 +\/- 5, and 49 +\/- 9% of control, respectively.

A total of 96 genes related to hereditary cardiomyopathy were detected by exon and boarding intron analyses in the proband using second-generation sequencing. Mutations identified in the proband were confirmed by bi-directional Sanger sequencing in the rest 9 family members and 300 healthy controls.\nThree mutations, including MYBPC3-P1208fs, ANK2-H556R and ANK2-P1974H, were identified in this pedigree. MYBPC3-P1208fs gene mutation was detected in 3 family members (proband, his mother and son), while this mutation was not detected in the rest family members. HCM was diagnosed in the proband and his mother by ECG, UCG and CMR. Son of the proband demonstrated early phenotype of HCM: although UCG and CMR were normal, ECG showed sinus bradycardia and paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias as well as ST segment changes. The onset age of HCM diagnosis of the proband and his mother was 42 and 50 years old, presented with palpitation and chest pain, and myocardial fibrosis sign in CMR. Furthermore, we found that left ventricular myocardial fibrosis is related to ECG changes (increasing r wave, ST segment change) in the proband and his mother.

All patients were treated by pharmacomechanical thrombectomy with local lytic therapy. Catheter-directed lysis and vena cava filters were used sparingly. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. The independent variable used in the logistic regression model was symptom relief.\nForty-four patients (mean age, 52.1 \u00b1 15.8 years) presented with symptoms averaging 13.4 \u00b1 9.9 days in duration. Twenty (45.4%) had symptoms for >14 days. Seventeen patients were treated in one session, but 27 patients required lytic infusion for residual thrombus. Iliac stenting was required in 49% of limbs. Successful lysis (>50%) was achieved in 91% of patients, and symptom resolution or improvement in 91%. All patients became ambulatory, with no or minimal limitation. No major systemic bleeding complications occurred. Freedom from DVT recurrence and reintervention was 84% at 24 months by life-table analysis. Preoperative ultrasound imaging showed 89% had popliteal and tibial clots. A thrombosed popliteal vein was accessed for treatment and was corroborated by venographic findings.

As such, this cytokine may maintain the corneal endothelium in a G1-phase-arrested state in vivo. The purpose of these studies was to determine the effect of exogenous TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta2 in aqueous humor on DNA synthesis in cultured corneal endothelial cells.\nRat corneal endothelial cells were grown in explant culture and identified by morphology and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers for specific corneal cell markers. Subconfluent cells were synchronized in the G0 phase (quiescence) by serum starvation for 24 hours.

Preincubation of exogenous TGF-beta2 or activated rat aqueous humor with neutralizing antibody was used to test for cytokine specificity.\nA linear increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation began approximately 16 hours after serum addition, and peak incorporation occurred at approximately 24 hours. Exposure of cells to serum plus TGF-beta2 suppressed [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging from 5 pg\/ml to 5 ng\/ml.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are naturally occurring mediators capable of modulating both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity via the CB1 receptor. Previous work on eCB modulation of excitatory synapses in the CA1 region largely focuses on the SC pathway. However, little information is available on whether and how eCBs modulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity at PP synapses.\nBy employing somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings, Ca(2+) uncaging, and immunostaining, we demonstrate that there are significant differences in low-frequency stimulation (LFS)- or DHPG-, an agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), induced long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission between SC and PP synapses in the same pyramidal neurons. These differences are eliminated by pharmacological inhibition with selective CB1 receptor antagonists or genetic deletion of the CB1 receptor, indicating that these differences likely result from differential modulation via a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. We also revealed that depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a form of short-term synaptic plasticity, and photolysis of caged Ca(2+)-induced suppression of Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were less at the PP than that at the SC.

Cells were treated with different concentrations of GANT61 alone or in combination with cisplatin. Cell proliferation was assessed with CCK-8 assays, and cell invasion and migration were performed using 8-\u00b5m transwell inserts. Cell apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometric analysis and rhodamine 123. qPCR was used to complete RNA experiments. Protein expression was assessed with Western blotting.\nThe GANT61 significantly inhibited cell proliferation. GANT61 decreased the cell migration and invasion, impairing these crucial steps in tumour progression. Cell apoptosis was significantly increased in Daoy cells. Rhodamine 123 assay showed that GANT61 could decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential promoting cell mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. GANT61 inhibited the expression of GLI and Bcl-2 at both the mRNA and protein levels and might affect the expression of Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 to promote cell intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, GANT61 could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis to decrease the IC50 value of cisplatin.

BP variability was depicted as s.d. of 4-8 serial measurements in childhood.\nBlacks showed significantly greater childhood systolic BP (SBP) variability than whites. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusting for race, sex, mean childhood age, s.d. of childhood body mass index (BMI), mean childhood BP levels, adulthood age and BMI, adult hypertension was significantly associated with s.d. of childhood SBP (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence intervals) = 1.28 (1.09, 1.51), P = 0.002) and s.d. of childhood diastolic BP (DBP; 1.36 (1.16, 1.58), P < 0.001).

The role of YAP1 in tumorigenesis is unclear. We aimed to investigate the functional role of YAP1 in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.\nYAP1 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma was evaluated. The biological function was determined by proliferation assay, colony formation, cell invasion, and flow cytometric analysis through knocking down or ectopic expressing YAP1 in gastric cancer cell lines coupled with in vivo study. The possible downstream effectors of YAP1 were investigated by expression microarray.\nYAP1 protein expression was upregulated in gastric cancer. Nuclear accumulation of YAP1 was associated with poor disease-specific survival (P = 0.021), especially in patients with early-stage diseases (P < 0.001). Knockdown YAP1 resulted in a significant reduction in proliferation, anchorage-dependent colony formation, cell invasion, and cell motility. Ectopic YAP1 expression promoted anchorage-independent colony formation, induced a more invasive phenotype, and accelerated cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis highlighted the alteration of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway by YAP1. We confirmed a constitutive activation of RAF\/MEK\/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) in YAP1-expressing MKN45 cells and further showed that YAP1 enhanced serum\/epidermal growth factor-induced c-Fos expression in gastric cancer cells."},{"passage":"There are four cell lineages derived from intestinal stem cells that are located at the crypt and villus in the mammalian intestine the non-secretory absorptive enterocytes, and the secretory cells, which include mucous-secreting goblet cells, regulatory peptide-secreting enteroendocrine cells and antimicrobial peptide-secreting Paneth cells. Although fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling is important for cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues, its role in intestinal differentiation is less well understood.\nWe used a loss of function approach to investigate the importance of Fgf signaling in intestinal cell differentiation in zebrafish; abnormal differentiation of goblet cells was observed when Fgf signaling was inhibited using SU5402 or in the Tg(hsp70ldnfgfr1-EGFP) transgenic line. We identified Fgfr2c as an important receptor for cell differentiation. The number of goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells was reduced in fgfr2c morphants. In addition to secretory cells, enterocyte differentiation was also disrupted in fgfr2c morphants. Furthermore, proliferating cells were increased in the morphants. Interestingly, the loss of fgfr2c expression repressed secretory cell differentiation and increased cell proliferation in the mib(ta52b) mutant that had defective Notch signaling."},{"passage":"Elective colectomy for diverticular disease is common. Some patients undergo primary resection with proximal diversion in an effort to limit morbidity associated with potential anastomotic leak.\nThe American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was queried.

Fasting blood samples were obtained from all patients for biological profile measurements, and demographic data were collected. Values of FLI were determined and assessed as predictors of the presence of NAFLD, as measured by ultrasound. The discriminative ability of FLI was estimated on the basis of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve.\nAn FLI of 60 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy and yielded an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.822 (95% confidence interval: 0.729-0.916) in the detection of NAFLD. Patients with an FLI of 60 or higher had a significantly lower lowest O2 saturation (73 vs. 83%, P<0.001), a lower mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (93 vs. 95%, P<0.001), a higher apnea-hypopnea index (39.7 vs. 18.4, P<0.001), a higher oxygen desaturation index (39 vs. 10.6, P<0.001), and a higher percentage of sleep time spent with SpO2 less than 90% (4.63 vs. 0.92%, P<0.001) compared with those with FLI less than 60.

COX-2 activity was assessed by measuring prostaglandin E(2) production by enzyme-linked immunoassay. COX-2 mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR.\nExposure to curcumin (10-15 micromol\/L) and physiologic doses of celecoxib (5 micromol\/L) resulted in a synergistic inhibitory effect on cell growth. Growth inhibition was associated with inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Curcumin augmented celecoxib inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) synthesis.

Owing to the increase in inflammation in the skin of patients with T1Rs, we sought to investigate the activation of the innate immune system during reactionary events. Specifically, we investigated the expression levels of human beta-defensins (hBDs) 2 and 3 in the skin of patients with T1Rs, in keratinocytes, and in macrophages stimulated with M. leprae and corticosteroids.\nSkin biopsies from twenty-three patients with Type 1 reactions were found to have higher transcript levels of hBD3 as compared to fifteen leprosy patients without Type 1 reactions, as measured by qPCR. Moreover, we observed that keratinocytes but not macrophages up-regulated hBD2 and hBD3 in response to M. leprae stimulation in vitro.

The epithelium was wounded by scraping with a 6-mm-wide blade to create a smooth denuded edge and cell migration was measured 8 h later. Cells were grown in control DMEM with 5% FBS with or without 0.01-2 mM taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA). In parallel experiments, cells were harvested for Northern analysis of TGFbeta and GAPDH expression; [3H]thymidine uptake was used to measure proliferation. Anti-TGFbeta antibody was added to cells grown in the presence of 0.05 mM TDCA and migration was measured at 8 h.\nTDCA at physiologic luminal concentrations augments IEC-6 cell migration, with a maximal effect at 0.05 mM.

It is induced in several pathological conditions including cancer, obesity, and type II diabetes implying that this enzyme is implicated in other biological processes beyond its role in phase I metabolism. Despite the detailed description of the role of CYP2E1 in the liver, its functions in other tissues have not been extensively studied. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of CYP2E1 in breast carcinogenesis.\nCellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by H2DCFDA (2 2.9.2 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) staining and autophagy was assessed by tracing the cellular levels of autophagy markers using western blot assays. The endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) were detected by luciferase assays reflecting the splicing of mRNA encoding the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) transcription factor and cell migration was evaluated using the scratch wound assay. Gene expression was recorded with standard transcription assays including luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation.\nEctopic expression of CYP2E1 induced ROS generation, affected autophagy, stimulated endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibited migration in breast cancer cells with different metastatic potential and p53 status.

Total RNA in the liver tissue was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae Canine Genome Arrays. Using a 2.0-fold cutoff and false discovery rate <0.10, our results indicated that expression of 234 genes was altered by age, while 137 genes were differentially expressed by diet. Based on functional classification, genes affected by age and\/or diet were involved in cellular development, nutrient metabolism, and signal transduction. In general, gene expression suggested that senior dogs had an increased risk of the progression of liver disease and dysfunction, as observed in aged humans and rodents. In particular for aged liver, genes related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and glycolysis were up-regulated, whereas genes related to regeneration, xenobiotic metabolism, and cholesterol trafficking were down-regulated.

Subcutaneous administration of epinephrine is generally used in surgery to decrease bleeding due to local vasoconstriction. The effect of epinephrine on the sphincter muscle tone was investigated during general anaesthesia in children.\nTen children scheduled for skin graft or plastic surgery of the ear were studied. A gastrointestinal pressure sensor was inserted nasally, and the intraluminal pressures of the lower oesophagus, lower oesophageal sphincter and stomach were monitored under sevoflurane, nitrous oxide anaesthesia. The effect of epinephrine on the lower oesophageal sphincter muscle tone was measured.\nThe resting pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter muscle tone significantly decreased from 4.56 +\/- 1.85 to 3.79 +\/- 1.11 kPa after 3 microg kg(-1) epinephrine for 4 min. The barrier pressure is the difference between the lower oesophageal sphincter and intragastric pressure, and that decreased to 1.23 +\/- 1.17 kPa from the 2.07 +\/- 1.77 kPa resting level.

The viral proteins were determined by immunolotting and immunofluorescence. The virus titer was measured by plaque assay. To verify whether the activity of host RNA polymerase II was affected by flavopiridol, the phosphorylation status of RNA polymerase II CTD domain was analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphor-specific antibody. The amount of viral mRNA, vRNA and cRNA was measured by reverse transcription and PCR.\nThe amount of viral proteins was significantly decreased and the titer of virus was greatly reduced in cells treated with flavopiridol. Further analysis showed that the phosphorylation of Ser-2 in the heptad repeat of the CTD domain in RNA polymerase II was decreased in falvopiridol treated cell. This result indicated that the transcription elongation activity of RNA pol II was impaired upon treatment with flavopiridol. Then we found that the amount of viral vRNA was significantly decreased in flavopiridol treated cells while only moderate decrease of mRNA was observed and almost no reduction of cRNA was detected."},{"passage":"Genetic variants in 296 genes in regions identified through admixture mapping of hypertension, BMI, and lipids were assessed for association with hypertension, blood pressure (BP), BMI, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).\nThis study identified coding SNPs identified from HapMap2 data that were located in genes on chromosomes 5, 6, 8, and 21, wherein ancestry association evidence for hypertension, BMI, or HDL-C was identified in previous admixture mapping studies. Genotyping was performed in 1733 unrelated African-Americans from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Family Blood Pressure Project, and gene-based association analyses were conducted for hypertension, SBP, DBP, BMI, and HDL-C.

C3 deposition and HUVEC-surface expression of CD46 and CD55 were evaluated by ELISA and flow cytometry. C3 deposition on HUVECs subjected to 12 or 24 hours of hypoxia followed by 3 hours of reoxygenation was significantly greater than normoxic HUVECs. Inhibition of the classic but not the alternative complement pathway during reoxygenation attenuated C3 deposition. Western blot analysis of HUVEC lysates under reducing conditions demonstrated significantly increased iC3b deposition in hypoxic\/reoxygenated HUVECs compared with normoxic HUVECs.

Immunohistochemical studies assessed GnRH protein expression. FNC-B4 migration was analyzed with multiwell Boyden chamber technique.\nEffects of the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and leptin in FNC-B4 were tested after 24 and 48 hours.\nExposure to increasing concentrations of DHT after 24 hours significantly stimulated GnRH mRNA in FNC-B4. This effect was still present after prolonged exposure (48 hours). Similarly, treatment with leptin significantly induced GnRH mRNA after 24 hours, but not at 48 hours. Interestingly, mRNA for leptin receptors (LEPR) was significantly reduced after 48 hours of leptin, while, at this time point, it was stimulated by DHT. Coincubation for 48 hours with leptin and DHT maintained the stimulatory effect on both GnRH and LEPR mRNA, suggesting that DHT could stabilize the leptin effect by preventing downregulation of LEPR. Similar results were obtained for GnRH protein expression analysis. Moreover, both DHT and leptin increased GnRH release into the culture medium. We also found that DHT or leptin treatment significantly increased FNC-B4 basal migration. As we previously found that GnRH stimulates FNC-B4 migration, we hypothesized that this effect could be mediated by DHT- and leptin-induced GnRH release. Accordingly, the GnRH antagonist cetrorelix inhibited DHT- and leptin-induced migration."},{"passage":"Critically ill patients sometimes require transport to another location.

Many retinal diseases occur as a result of inherited dysfunction of the rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Development and maintenance of photoreceptors requires appropriate regulation of the many genes specifically or highly expressed in these cells. Over the last decades, different experimental approaches have been developed to identify photoreceptor enriched genes. Recent progress in RNA analysis technology has generated large amounts of gene expression data relevant to retinal development. This paper assesses a machine learning methodology for supporting the identification of photoreceptor enriched genes based on expression data.\nBased on the analysis of publicly-available gene expression data from the developing mouse retina generated by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), this paper presents a predictive methodology comprising several in silico models for detecting key complex features and relationships encoded in the data, which may be useful to distinguish genes in terms of their functional roles. In order to understand temporal patterns of photoreceptor gene expression during retinal development, a two-way cluster analysis was firstly performed. By clustering SAGE libraries, a hierarchical tree reflecting relationships between developmental stages was obtained. By clustering SAGE tags, a more comprehensive expression profile for photoreceptor cells was revealed. To demonstrate the usefulness of machine learning-based models in predicting functional associations from the SAGE data, three supervised classification models were compared. The results indicated that a relatively simple instance-based model (KStar model) performed significantly better than relatively more complex algorithms, e.g. neural networks. To deal with the problem of functional class imbalance occurring in the dataset, two data re-sampling techniques were studied. A random over-sampling method supported the implementation of the most powerful prediction models.

Consistent with SF1126 treatment's effects on HIF-1\u03b1\/HIF-2\u03b1, microvessel density analysis of Caki and 786-0 tumor tissues demonstrated that SF1126 has potent antiangiogenic activity in vivo. Finally, SF1126 caused a profound inhibition of integrin-mediated migration and blocked the integrin-induced conversion of GDP-Rac1 to its GTP-bound active state."},{"passage":"We evaluated the effect of GaAs (904-nm) laser, applied directly to the skin of injured muscle, in muscle regeneration.\nMuscle injury was induced in the Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle by ACL myotoxin (5 mg\/kg).

Complement component 3 (C3) fixation, a marker for complement activation, was determined with a monoclonal anti-human C3d antibody. Enzymatic properties of HL and CE were assayed with triglyceride and phosphatidylcholine substrates for triglyceride hydrolase and phospholipase A activities. The ARPE-19 cells were used for viability studies.\nThe HL degradation of human lipoproteins LDL, VLDL, or HDL results in the formation of modified lipoproteins that can activate the complement pathway. Complement activation is dose- and time-dependent upon HL and occurs via the classical pathway. Enzymatic studies suggest that the phospholipase A1 activity of HL generates complement-activating lysophospholipids. C-reactive protein (CRP), known to simultaneously interact with complement C1 and complement factor H (CFH), further enhances HL-induced complement activation. The lysophospholipids, 1-Palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, can be directly cytotoxic to ARPE-19 cells."},{"passage":"Female gender is a risk factor for early pain after several specific surgical procedures but has not been studied in detail after laparoscopic groin hernia repair.

Patients in the two groups received a similar anesthetic, surgical, and analgesic treatment protocol.\nBetween August 2009 and August 2010, 25 women and 25 men undergoing elective TAPP were prospectively included in the analysis (n = 50) with no significant difference between groups in psychological status regarding anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing. On day 0, women had significantly more pain during rest (p = 0.015) and coughing (p = 0.012), discomfort (p = 0.001), and fatigue (0.020) compared with men. Additionally, cumulative overall postoperative pain during coughing, discomfort, and fatigue on day 0-3 was significantly higher in women compared with men (all p values < 0.05).

Grading of late AMD was classified based on a standardized set of diagnostic criteria established by the International Age-Related Maculopathy Epidemiologic Study. Late AMD was classified as either atrophic (dry, grade 4) or neovascular (wet, grade 5). Atrophic AMD refers to dry late-stage AMD without neovascularization, and wet AMD refers to neovascular AMD. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was prepared from peripheral blood obtained from all AMD patients and control subjects. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to analyze this polymorphism.\nOf the 190 participants with late AMD, atrophic AMD was diagnosed in 104 patients and wet AMD was diagnosed in 86 patients. The genotype distribution of the Met72Thr (T\/C) variant of PEDF was TT (homozygous T), TC (heterozygous), and CC (homozygous C). The T allele was found significantly more frequently in wet AMD patients than in controls (50% vs 31%; P =.0005). The allele frequencies in atrophic AMD (30%) and controls (31%) did not differ significantly (all P = .87). The homozygous T genotype was more prevalent in wet AMD than in controls (26\/86 [30%] vs nine\/90 [10%]; odds ratio, 3.9; all P = .0015). The homozygous T genotype in atrophic AMD patients (8%) and controls (10%) did not differ significantly (all P = .75)."},{"passage":"Kwashiorkor, a form of severe malnutrition with high mortality, is characterized by edema and systemic abnormalities. Although extremely common, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood, and its characteristic physical signs are unexplained.\nBecause kwashiorkor can develop in protein-losing enteropathy, which is caused by a loss of enterocyte heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), and previous observations suggest abnormal sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) metabolism, we examined whether intestinal GAG and HSPG are abnormal in children with kwashiorkor.\nDuodenal biopsy samples collected from Zambian children with marasmus (n = 18), marasmic kwashiorkor (n = 8), and kwashiorkor (n = 15) were examined for expression of HSPG, GAGs, and immunologic markers and compared against reference samples from healthy UK control children. GAG and HSPG expression density and inflammatory cell populations were quantitated by computerized analysis.\nThe kwashiorkor group was less wasted and had a lower HIV incidence than did the other groups. All duodenal biopsy samples showed inflammation compared with the histologically uninflamed control samples. Biopsy samples from marasmic children had greater inflammation and greater CD3+ and HLA-DR (human leukocyte antigen DR)-positive cell densities than did samples from children with kwashiorkor. Expression of both HSPG and GAGs was similar between marasmic and well-nourished UK children but was markedly lower in children with kwashiorkor in both the epithelium and lamina propria. Although underglycosylated and undersulfated, epithelial syndecan-1 protein was normally expressed in kwashiorkor, which confirmed that abnormalities arise after core protein synthesis."},{"passage":"This study estimates the prevalence of disability among late middle-aged women and identifies important correlates of disability among this population.\nDisability was assessed among 376 participants of the Michigan Study of Women's Health Across the Nation cohort at the 2011 follow-up using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Demographic and health measures were related to disability status using logistic regression models (none or mild vs. moderate, severe, or extreme disability).\nNearly 25% of women reported moderate to extreme global disability.

Baseline prednisone (<10 mg\/day) and other concomitant SLE medications were to remain constant. The levels of cytokines including interleukin (IL) 1, IL2, interferon gamma, IL4, and IL10 were determined by ELISA. The mean change from baseline to 24 weeks of therapy was analysed.\nThe two groups (DHEA n = 15; placebo n = 15) were well balanced for baseline characteristics. Only IL1beta and IL10 could be detected in the serum of lupus patients; however, there was no significant mean (SD) difference in serum IL1beta before and after treatment (9.94 (8.92) v 9.20 (6.49) pg\/ml).

All men who did not receive neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and for whom complete follow-up data were available were included in the analysis (of 607, 260 were African-American and 347 were white). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the significance of race as an independent predictor of surgical margin status after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.\nAfter controlling for clinical stage, Gleason grade, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that race was not an independent predictor of positive surgical margins (P = 0.9).

The gestational weight gain was defined by pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI). Weight retention was defined as the difference between pre-gestational weight and weight at postpartum. Data were analyzed using McNemar's Test, ANOVA with Bonferroni correction and multiple linear regression.\nOf the 715 pregnant women recruited, 545 were assessed 12 months after delivery. Women were more likely to be overweight 12 months postpartum compared to the pre-pregnancy period (52.9 versus 36.7%) and weight retention during the 12 months postpartum was more than 10 kg in 30.7% of the women. Weight retention in the postpartum period was higher among women who were overweight (9.9 \u00b1 7.7 kg) compared to those who were of normal weight during the pre-pregnancy period (7.6 \u00b1 6.2 kg).

To better understand the mechanism of the candidate therapeutic, flibanserin, we determined its effects on an index of brain glucose metabolism.\nWe hypothesized that chronic treatment with flibanserin would alter metabolism in brain regions associated with serotonergic function and female sexual behavior.\nIn a crossover design, eight adult female common marmosets (Calithrix jacchus) received daily flibanserin or vehicle. After 7-12 weeks of treatment, the glucose metabolism radiotracer [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was administered to each female immediately prior to 30 minutes of interaction with her male pairmate, after which females were anesthetized and imaged by positron emission tomography. Whole-brain normalized images were analyzed with anatomically defined regions of interest. Whole-brain voxelwise mapping was used to explore treatment effects.

There were no exclusion criteria. Disabling pain was defined as moderate or severe pain restricting physical activity. Multiple logistic regression analysis of disabling pain during pregnancy and persistent pain after delivery comprised the duration of COC use adjusted for age, pain in a previous pregnancy and a history of back pain when not pregnant.\nThe study comprised 161 women. Pain during pregnancy was classified as disabling in 57 of the women (35%), pain in a previous pregnancy being a risk factor, odds ratio (OR) 5.0 (95% CI 2.1; 12.1), whereas no association was found with the duration of COC use. Persistent pain eight months after delivery was reported by 41 women (26%), risk factors being a history of back pain when not pregnant; OR 7.5 (2.8; 19.5), disabling pain in the recent pregnancy; OR 5.0 (1.9; 13.4), and short use of COC; 0-<1 year; OR 4.2 (1.3; 12.9), 1-<5 years; OR 4.6 (1.5; 14.4) (reference=>10 years)."},{"passage":"Chronic increases in blood flow induce remodeling associated with increases in diameter and endothelium-mediated dilation.

After three weeks, arteries were collected for structural, pharmacological, and biochemical analysis.\nIn HF arteries, luminal diameter (431+\/-12 to 553+\/-14 microm; n=10), endothelium (acetylcholine)-mediated vasodilatation (61+\/-6 to 77+\/-6% relaxation) and NAD(P)H subunit (gp91phox and p67phox) expression levels, and ROS (dihydroethydine microphotography) and peroxynitrite (3-nitro-tyrosine) production were higher than in normal flow arteries. Acute ROS scavenging with tempol improved acetylcholine-dependent relaxation (92+\/-4% relaxation), confirming that ROS are produced in HF arteries. Chronic treatment with tempol prevented the increase in diameter, reduced ROS and peroxynitrite production, and improved endothelium-mediated relaxation in HF arteries. Thus, ROS and NO were involved in HF-induced diameter enlargement, possibly through the formation of peroxynitrite, while ROS reduced the increase in endothelium-dependent relaxation."},{"passage":"To determine whether switching within or between antidepressant therapy (ADT) classes prior to the use of adjunctive antipsychotic treatment is associated with different outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD).\nThis was a post hoc analysis of pooled data from 3 similar, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registrational studies of aripiprazole adjunctive to ADT conducted between September 2004 and April 2008.

Nine healthy subjects were treated with placebo as controls. Blood samples were obtained before and after stimulation with CSFs or placebo. White blood cells were separated and concentrations of both active DHFR and immunoreactive nonfunctional form of DHFR were determined in their cytoplasm using methotrexate-binding assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Total leucocytes count (TLC) was also monitored before and after stimulation with CSFs or placebo.\nThere was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in concentration of immunoreactive nonfunctional form of DHFR and TLC following stimulation with CSFs. There was an increase in concentration of active DHFR as well, however, this did not reach statistical significance. In the placebo-treated subjects, no significant increase in active DHFR, immunoreactive nonfunctional form of enzyme or TLC was observed.

The transduced SCC cells were treated with different doses of GRh2, and then analyzed cell viability by CCK-8 assay and MTT assay. The effects of GRh2 on Lgr5-positive CSCs were determined by fow cytometry and by tumor sphere formation. Autophagy-associated protein and \u03b2-catenin were measured by Western blot. Expression of short hairpin small interfering RNA (shRNA) for Atg7 and \u03b2-catenin were used to inhibit autophagy and \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, respectively, as loss-of-function experiments.\nWe found that GRh2 dose-dependently reduced SCC viability, possibly through reduced the number of Lgr5-positive CSCs. GRh2 increased autophagy and reduced \u03b2-catenin signaling in SCC cells. Inhibition of autophagy abolished the effects of GRh2 on \u03b2-catenin and cell viability, while increasing \u03b2-catenin abolished the effects of GRh2 on autophagy and cell viability."},{"passage":"The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the antioxidants vitamin E, vitamin C and vitamin B1 can reduce the transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-\u03b22)-induced gene expressions in cultured human optic nerve head (ONH) astrocytes.\nCultured human ONH astrocytes were pretreated with different concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin C and vitamin B1 and then exposed to 1.0 ng\/ml TGF-\u03b22 for 24 hr.

Subjects in this study included younger-onset (n = 311) and older-onset (n = 279) diabetic subjects who had retinopathy at baseline and did not know it.\nForty-two percent of younger-onset and 29% of older-onset subjects recalled at follow-up that they had been told their diabetes had affected their eyes. People in both groups were more likely to recall they had retinopathy if they had more severe retinopathy, had more symptoms of neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease, had seen an ophthalmologist within 2 yr, or monitored their blood glucose more often. In addition, younger-onset diabetic subjects with poorer visual acuity or who were on a combination insulin regimen and older-onset people taking insulin, having more education, or who were younger were more likely to recall they had retinopathy.

Observers reported whether they perceived nontransparent (corresponding to visual integration of motion cues into one surface) or transparent (segmentation of two surfaces from motion cues) plaid motion within a 5 degrees central circular region. Surround stimuli were 20 degrees transparent or nontransparent moving plaids.\nContextual effects required the presence of both local and global ambiguity. If central local motion became unambiguous, then surrounds became ineffective. Under local and global ambiguity, transparent surrounds invariably induced central congruence while also strongly suppressing incongruent percepts. Nontransparent surrounds produced similar but less consistent congruent bias, especially for longer viewing times. In the latter case, however, suppression of incongruent central interpretations became barely detectable compared to the observed significant facilitation of congruent percepts."},{"passage":"IL-31 is a novel cytokine that, when overexpressed in transgenic mice, induces severe itching dermatitis resembling human eczema.\nWe aimed to evaluate the importance of polymorphisms in the human IL-31 gene (IL31) in the genetic susceptibility to eczema.\nWe sequenced the entire IL-31 gene, including the promoter region, and determined the haplotype structure.

This concept is further supported by the induction of premature senescence, a process which is activated when an oncogene is expressed in normal primary cells as well as following intense genotoxic stresses. Thus, deregulation of genes that control this process, like the tumor suppressor p53, may contribute to promoting cancer by allowing cells to bypass senescence. A better understanding of the genes that contribute to the establishment of senescence is therefore warranted. Necdin interacts with p53 and is also a p53 target gene, although the importance of Necdin in the p53 response is not clearly understood.\nIn this study, we first investigated Necdin protein expression during replicative senescence and premature senescence induced by gamma irradiation and by the overexpression of oncogenic RasV12. Gain and loss of function experiments were used to evaluate the contribution of Necdin during the senescence process.\nNecdin expression declined during replicative aging of IMR90 primary human fibroblasts or following induction of premature senescence. Decrease in Necdin expression seemed to be a consequence of the establishment of senescence since the depletion of Necdin in human cells did not induce a senescence-like growth arrest nor a flat morphology or SA-\u03b2-galactosidase activity normally associated with senescence. Similarly, overexpression of Necdin did not affect the life span of IMR90 cells.

Recently, the transient receptor potential melastatin 6 (TRPM6) was identified as the gatekeeper of active Mg(2+) transport and therefore plays a crucial role in the regulation of Mg(2+) homeostasis. Remarkably, TRPM6 combines a Mg(2+) channel with an alpha-kinase domain whose function remains elusive.\nHere, we identify the receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1) as the first regulatory protein of TRPM6 that associates with the alpha-kinase domain. RACK1 and TRPM6 are both present in renal Mg(2+)-transporting distal convoluted tubules. We demonstrate that RACK1 inhibits channel activity in an alpha-kinase activity-dependent manner, whereas small interference (si) RNA-mediated knockdown of RACK1 increases the current. Moreover, threonine(1851) in the alpha-kinase domain was identified as an autophosphorylation site of which the phosphorylation state is essential for the inhibitory effect of RACK1. Importantly, threonine(1851) was crucial for the Mg(2+) sensitivity of TRPM6 autophosphorylation and channel activity. TRPM6 channel activity was less sensitive to Mg(2+) when RACK1 was knocked down by siRNA.

The protein and transcript levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by ELISA and RT-PCR. Phosphorylation of p38MAPK was investigated through Western blot analysis in HK-2 cells induced by CRP. The activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) was studied via EMSA. A specific p38MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) and an NF-\u03baB inhibitor (PDTC; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) were used to analyze the signal transduction in CRP induction. To explore the direct or indirect role of CRP in HK-2 cells, IL-6 or TSP-1 antibodies were used. The expression of IL-6, TSP-1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1 )(TGF-\u03b2(1)) were determined through Western blot analysis in HK-2 cells.\nIn HK-2 cells, purified CRP significantly induced protein release and mRNA expression of IL-6 and TSP-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TGF-\u03b2(1) protein was overexpressed in HK-2 cells induced by CRP, which cannot be inhibited by IL-6 or TSP-1 antibodies. CRP triggered phosphorylation of p38MAPK and activation of NF-\u03baB-mediated signal transduction.

Here, the effect of ZWF1 and POS5 overexpression on carotenoid yield in recombinant S.\u00a0cerevisiae was explored. The initial carotenogenic strain Sc-EYBIH+I which expressed crtE, crtYB, crtI, cHMG1 and another copy of crtI could synthesize 1\u00b735\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b713\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) of lycopene and 0\u00b732\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b702\u00a0mg\u00a0l(-1) of \u03b2-carotene.

They cycle between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound states. This cycle is tightly regulated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide-exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins). Mouse CdGAP (mCdc42 GTPase-activating protein) has been previously identified and characterized as a specific GAP for Rac1 and Cdc42, but not for RhoA. It consists of an N-terminal RhoGAP domain and a C-terminal proline-rich region. In addition, CdGAP-related genes are present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have recently reported that two predominant isoforms of CdGAP (250 and 90 kDa) exist in specific mouse tissues.\nIn the present study, we have identified and characterized human CdGAP (KIAA1204) which shares 76% sequence identity to the long isoform of mCdGAP (mCdGAP-l). Similar to mCdGAP, it is active in vitro and in vivo on both Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA, and is phosphorylated in vivo on serine and threonine residues. In contrast with mCdGAP-l, human CdGAP interacts with ERK1\/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1\/2) through a region that does not involve a DEF (docking site for ERK Phe-Xaa-Phe-Pro) domain. Also, the tissue distribution of CdGAP proteins appears to be different between human and mouse species.

Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of NOTCH1, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as RUNX2 and BMP2. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern.\nMultidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to document the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to document the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve.\nWe documented that lncRNA H19 (H19) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with H19 expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that H19 induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that H19 silenced NOTCH1 by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of H19 in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of NOTCH1 and decreased the level of RUNX2 and BMP2, 2 downstream targets repressed by NOTCH1.

Since fetal programming is an offspring sex specific process, male and female offspring were analyzed separately. Multivariable regression analyses considering maternal BMI, paternal and maternal age, hypertension during pregnancy, maternal total glycated serum protein, parity and either gestational age (for birth weight) or time of ultrasound investigation (for ultrasound parameters) as confounding showed that paternal BMI is associated with growth of the male but not female offspring. Paternal BMI correlated with birth parameters of male offspring only: birth weight; biparietal diameter, head circumference; abdominal diameter, abdominal circumference; and pectoral diameter.

Activities of protein phosphatases were monitored under the cell-free conditions. Indomethacin binding assay was carried out using a fluorescein-conjugated indomethacin.\nIndomethacin enhanced CaMKII activity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, that is abolished the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93. In the cell-free assay, no CaMKII activation was obtained with indomethacin, but indomethacin otherwise inhibited PP1 in a concentration (10 \u00b5M-1 mM)-dependent manner, the maximum reaching 70% of basal levels. This indicates that indomethacin indirectly activates CaMKII due to PP1 inhibition. Likewise, indomethacin still inhibited PP2A and PTP1B in a concentration (10 \u00b5M-1 mM)-dependent manner, reaching 80 and 10% of basal levels at 1 mM, respectively.

Plastid division involves nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial division proteins such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, and ARC6. However, homologs of many other cyanobacterial division genes are missing in plant genomes and proteins of host eukaryotic origin, such as a dynamin-related protein, PDV1 and PDV2 are involved in the division process. Recent identification of plastid division proteins has started to elucidate the similarities and differences between plastid division and cyanobacterial cell division. To further identify new proteins that are required for plastid division, we characterized previously and newly isolated plastid division mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana.\nLeaf cells of two mutants, br04 and arc2, contain fewer, larger chloroplasts than those of wild type. We found that ARC2 and BR04 are identical to nuclear genes encoding the plastid chaperonin 60 alpha (ptCpn60alpha) and chaperonin 60 beta (ptCpn60beta) proteins, respectively. In both mutants, plastid division FtsZ ring formation was partially perturbed though the level of FtsZ2-1 protein in plastids of ptcpn60beta mutants was similar to that in wild type. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both ptCpn60 proteins are derived from ancestral cyanobacterial proteins. The A. thaliana genome encodes two members of ptCpn60alpha family and four members of ptCpn60beta family respectively. We found that a null mutation in ptCpn60alpha abolished greening of plastids and resulted in an albino phenotype while a weaker mutation impairs plastid division and reduced chlorophyll levels.

BMW significantly enhanced stress tolerance and increased the mean lifespan of worms during thermal and oxidative stress, although it did not extend lifespan at 20\u00b0C and attenuated age dependent decline in physiological behaviors. Moreover, it was shown that BMW was able to up-regulate expression of stress associated gene hsp-16.2, which significantly (P < 0.001) extends the mean lifespan of worms under stress conditions."},{"passage":"Stool-based colonoscopy is the preferred strategy for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.

We aimed to elucidate the vasoregulatory role of CO in the microcirculation in normal and thioacetamide cirrhotic rat livers.\nHaem-oxygenase expression was examined by Western blot. Total HO enzymatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Sensitivity of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to CO-mediated relaxation was studied by a stress-relaxed-collagen-lattice model. To define the relative role of CO, the CO-releasing molecule CORM-2, the HO-inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin-IX and the HO-1 inducer hemin were added to an in situ liver perfusion set-up. The topography of vasoactive CO production was evaluated by applying different CO- and nitric oxide-trapping reagents in the liver perfusion set-up and by immunohistochemistry.\nWestern blot showed decreased expression of both HO isoenzymes (P<0.036 for HO-1; P<0.001 for HO-2) in cirrhotic vs normal rat livers, confirmed by the HO-activity assay (P=0.004). HSCs relaxed on exposure to CORM-2 (P=0.013). The increased intrahepatic vascular resistance (IHVR) of cirrhotic rats was attenuated by perfusion with CORM-2 (P=0.016) and pretreatment with hemin (P<0.001).

Of the preoperative variables examined, only the preoperative AFP slope was identified as an independent predictor of tumour recurrence by multivariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the best discriminant cut-off value, calculated as the value of the maximized likelihood ratio, was preoperative AFP slope greater than 50 microg\/L per month. At this cut-off, sensitivity was 36%, and specificity was 97%. Patients with a preoperative AFP slope greater than 50 microg\/L per month had a much worse one-year recurrence-free survival rate than those with a preoperative AFP slope 50 microg\/L per month or less (40% versus 90%, P < 0.001)."},{"passage":"The aim of this study was to measure the capacity of glucose- and weight-related parameters to predict pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders in women with gestational diabetes.\nAn observational study was conducted involving 2037 women with gestational diabetes.

In vitro, HMGB1 did not affect clotting times, but inhibited the anticoagulant protein C pathway mediated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, and stimulated tissue factor expression on monocytes."},{"passage":"Directional preferences during center-out horizontal shoulder-elbow movements were previously established for both the dominant and non-dominant arm with the use of a free-stroke drawing task that required random selection of movement directions. While the preferred directions were mirror-symmetrical in both arms, they were attributed to a tendency specific for the dominant arm to simplify control of interaction torque by actively accelerating one joint and producing largely passive motion at the other joint. No conclusive evidence has been obtained in support of muscle effort minimization as a contributing factor to the directional preferences. Here, we tested whether distal load changes directional preferences, making the influence of muscle effort minimization on the selection of movement direction more apparent.\nThe free-stroke drawing task was performed by the dominant and non-dominant arm with no load and with 0.454 kg load at the wrist. Motion of each arm was limited to rotation of the shoulder and elbow in the horizontal plane. Directional histograms of strokes produced by the fingertip were calculated to assess directional preferences in each arm and load condition. Possible causes for directional preferences were further investigated by studying optimization across directions of a number of cost functions.\nPreferences in both arms to move in the diagonal directions were revealed. The previously suggested tendency to actively accelerate one joint and produce passive motion at the other joint was supported in both arms and load conditions. However, the load increased the tendency to produce strokes in the transverse diagonal directions (perpendicular to the forearm orientation) in both arms. Increases in required muscle effort caused by the load suggested that the higher frequency of movements in the transverse directions represented increased influence of muscle effort minimization on the selection of movement direction. This interpretation was supported by cost function optimization results."},{"passage":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a worldwide health problem with oxidative stress recognized as a major pathogenetic factor.

Apocynin (50 mg\/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before TBI. The expression of NOX2 protein was investigated using immunoblotting techniques 1 and 24h after TBI. Neurological score was evaluated 24h after TBI. Blood-brain barrier disruption was detected by Evans blue extravasation and cortical apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL assay. Additionally, we assessed tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA).\nNOX2 expression increased rapidly following TBI in male mice, with an early peak at 1h, followed by a second peak at 24h.

This episode of early cell death appears to be central to the teratogenic action of hydroxyurea. Several chemicals that are structurally related to hydroxyurea, and that possess a terminal hydroxylamine moiety (-NHOH), also produce limb abnormalities.\nTo investigate whether the hydroxylamine moiety is responsible for early cell death and, therefore, is likely to be associated with teratogenesis, five structurally related hydroxylamine-bearing chemicals (hydroxylamine hydrochloride, N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydroxyurea, acetohydroxamic acid, and hydroxyurethane) were administered at equimolar doses to rabbits either by subcutaneous (8.55 mmol\/kg) or intracoelomic (2.66 micromol\/embryo) injection on gestational day 12. Five additional chemicals, structurally similar to the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds, but possessing a terminal amino group (-NH(2)) (ammonium hydroxide, methylamine, urea, acetamide, and urethane), were tested at equimolar or higher doses by an identical protocol. In a subsequent experiment, the antioxidant propyl gallate (3.0 mmol\/kg or 1.30 micromol\/embryo) was co-administered with the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds to determine its effect on early cell death. Embryos were harvested 4 or 8 hr after treatment and analyzed by light microscopy.\nCellular debris was obvious in forelimb buds from embryos treated with the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds; however, none of the amino compounds produced an early episode of embryonic cell death. In all cases, the antioxidant propyl gallate prevented or delayed the early episode of cell death observed after treatment with the hydroxylamine-bearing compounds."},{"passage":"Recently we reported that amplification of the Zinc Finger Protein 217 (ZNF217) gene adversely affects survival of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.

We employed gain and loss of function approaches to validate the critical importance of these miRNAs as determinants of glioblastoma radiation resistance.\nOverexpression of miR1, miR125a, miR150, and\/or miR425 in glioblastoma promotes radioresistance through upregulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint response. Conversely, antagonizing with antagomiRs sensitizes glioblastoma cells to irradiation, suggesting their potential as targets for inhibiting therapeutic resistance. Analysis of glioblastoma data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that these miRNAs are expressed in glioblastoma patient specimens and correlate with transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling. Finally, it is demonstrated that expression of miR1 and miR125a can be induced by TGF\u03b2 and antagonized by a TGF\u03b2 receptor inhibitor.

Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have emerged as a major pathogenic factor for obesity and insulin resistance. ATMs consist of proinflammatory F4\/80(+)CD11c(+) macrophages and anti-inflammatory F4\/80(+)CD11c(-) macrophages. In this study, we assessed the effects of HFCS on ATMs in intra-abdominal fat.\nWe found that HFCS feeding in mice induced more severe adipose inflammation and insulin resistance than even the higher-calorie-containing 'Western' high-fat diet, and these HFCS-induced deleterious effects were independent of calorie intake or body fat content. We showed that similar to 'Western' high-fat diet, HFCS triggered a robust increase of both proinflammatory ATMs and anti-inflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat. Remarkably, however, the anti-inflammatory ATMs were much less abundant in HFCS-fed mice than in high-fat-fed mice. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R) ameliorates HFCS-induced adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. HFCS-fed GHS-R-null mice exhibit decreased proinflammatory ATMs in intra-abdominal fat, reduced adipose inflammation and attenuated liver steatosis."},{"passage":"Lineage specific differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is largely mediated by specific growth factors and extracellular matrix molecules. Growth factors initiate a cascade of signals which control gene transcription and cell fate specification. There is a lot of interest in inducing hESCs to an endoderm fate which serves as a pathway towards more functional cell types like the pancreatic cells. Research over the past decade has established several robust pathways for deriving endoderm from hESCs, with the capability of further maturation. However, in our experience, the functional maturity of these endoderm derivatives, specifically to pancreatic lineage, largely depends on specific pathway of endoderm induction. Hence it will be of interest to understand the underlying mechanism mediating such induction and how it is translated to further maturation. In this work we analyze the regulatory interactions mediating different pathways of endoderm induction by identifying co-regulated transcription factors.\nhESCs were induced towards endoderm using activin A and 4 different growth factors (FGF2 (F), BMP4 (B), PI3KI (P), and WNT3A (W)) and their combinations thereof, resulting in 15 total experimental conditions. At the end of differentiation each condition was analyzed by qRT-PCR for 12 relevant endoderm related transcription factors (TFs). As a first approach, we used hierarchical clustering to identify which growth factor combinations favor up-regulation of different genes. In the next step we identified sets of co-regulated transcription factors using a biclustering algorithm. The high variability of experimental data was addressed by integrating the biclustering formulation with bootstrap re-sampling to identify robust networks of co-regulated transcription factors. Our results show that the transition from early to late endoderm is favored by FGF2 as well as WNT3A treatments under high activin. However, induction of late endoderm markers is relatively favored by WNT3A under high activin."},{"passage":"Many patients who develop atrial fibrillation (AF) will experience a worsening of their arrhythmia over time.

We therefore predicted that characteristics of the great call would correlate with a caller's physical condition, and thus might honestly reflect resource holding potential (RHP). Because measurement of RHP is virtually impossible for wild animals, we used age as a proxy, hypothesizing that great call climaxes are difficult to produce and maintain over time, and that older adults will therefore perform lower quality great calls than young adults. To test this we analyzed the great call climaxes of 15 wild lar gibbon females at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand and 2 captive females at Leo Conservation Center, Greenwich, CT.\nFindings show that call climaxes correlate with female age, as young animals (n\u2009=\u20098, mean age: 12.9\u00a0years) produced climaxes with a higher frequency range (delta F0), maximum F0 frequency and duty cycle than old animals (n\u2009=\u20099, mean age: 29.6\u00a0years). A permuted discriminant function analysis also correctly classified calls by age group. During long song bouts the maximum F0 frequency of great call climaxes' also decreased. Additional data support the hypothesis that short high notes, associated with rapid inhalation as an individual catches its breath, reflect increased caller effort. Older females produced more high notes than younger females, but the difference only approached statistical significance, suggesting that calling effort may be similar across different ages.

Echocardiographic assessments were repeated up to six weeks after PTMC to evaluate the immediate PTMC outcome. The frequency of the optimal PTMC result (secondary MV area > = 1.5 cm(2) with > = 25% increase and without final mitral regurgitation grade > 2) was compared between two groups of patients with MAC (n = 17) and those without MAC (n = 70).\nThe optimal result was obtained in 55 (63.2%) patients, whereas the result was suboptimal in 32 (36.8%) patients due to insufficient MV area increase in 31(96.9%) subjects and post-procedure mitral regurgitation grade > 2 in 1(3.1%). The rate of optimal PTMC results was less in patients with MAC in comparison to those without MAC (29.4% vs.71.4%). After adjustments for possible confounders such as age and leaflets morphological subcomponents (thickening, mobility, calcification, and subvalvular thickening), MAC remained a significant negative predictor of a suboptimal PTMC result (odds ratio = 0.154; 95%CI = 0.038-0.626, p value = 0.009) together with leaflet thickening (odds ratio = 0.214; 95%CI = 0.060-0.770, p value = 0.018)."},{"passage":"Methyl donor deficiency (MDD) aggravates experimental colitis in rats and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through decreased sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in neuronal cells and myocardium. ER stress plays a key role in IBD pathogenesis.\nWe investigated whether the influence of MDD on colitis resulted from an ER stress response triggered by decreased SIRT1 expression.\nThe unfolded protein response (UPR), chaperones proteins, heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1) and SIRT1 were examined in rats with MDD and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a Caco-2 cell model with stable expression of transcobalamin-oleosin (TO) chimera, which impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12, and in IBD. The effects of SIRT1 activation were studied both in vitro and in vivo.\nMDD aggravated DSS-induced colitis clinically, endoscopically and histologically. MDD activated ER stress pathways, with increased phosphorylate-PKR-like ER kinase, P-eiF-2\u03b1, P-IRE-1\u03b1, activating transcription factor (ATF)6, XBP1-S protein and ATF4 mRNA expression levels in rats. This was accompanied by reduced SIRT1 expression level and greater acetylation of HSF1, in relation with a dramatic decrease of chaperones (binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), heat shock protein (HSP)27 and HSP90). Adding either vitamin B12, S-adenosylmethionine or an SIRT1 activator (SRT1720) reduced the UPR in vitro. In rats, SIRT1 activation by SRT1720 prevented colitis by reducing HSF1 acetylation and increasing expression of BIP, HSP27 and HSP90.

Breast tumours from patients submitted to surgery as primary therapeutic approach (15 hypertetraploid and the 138 non-hypertetraploid) were TNM staged and classified according to the histological type and grade. The remaining 36 patients had advanced neoplastic disease at presentation and were classified by cytological criteria only. DNA flow cytometric analysis was performed on fresh-frozen samples stained with propidium iodide. Hormone receptors were analysed by immunocytochemistry.\nThe incidence of hypertetraploid breast tumours was 5.9% (51 of 860). All the patients were women and the mean age at diagnosis was 65 years.

At the end of treatment, cell viability, migration and motility were evaluated, along with changes in oxidative stress pathway (ROS levels, NADPH and eNOS expression), on Akt phosphorylation and miR21 expression levels. CC2238\/\u03b1ANP reduced cell vitality, increased apoptosis and necrosis, increased oxidative stress levels, suppressed miR21 expression along with consistent changes of its molecular targets (PDCD4, PTEN, Bcl2) and of phosphorylated Akt levels. As a result of increased oxidative stress, CC2238\/\u03b1ANP markedly stimulated cell migration and increased cell contraction. NPR-C gene silencing with specific siRNAs restored cell viability, miR21 expression, and reduced oxidative stress induced by CC2238\/\u03b1ANP.

The gene complementing the tsBN269 cells was cloned and found to encode lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Indeed, tsBN269 cells were found to have a single cytosine to a thymine point mutation at the first nucleotide of codon 542 in hamster lysyl-tRNA synthetases. Due to this mutation, the activity of lysyl-tRNA synthetase was reduced--even at 33.5 degrees C, a permissive temperature. Consistent with these findings, while supplementation with lysine permitted tsBN269 cells to grow at a nonpermissive temperature, the deprivation of lysine caused apoptosis in tsBN269 cells, even at 33.5 degrees C. Cycloheximide inhibited the apoptosis caused by lysine starvation at 33.5 degrees C, but not at 39.5 degrees C.

We sought to test this by functionally expressing two medically important mammalian GPCRs, somatostatin receptor 2 (Sstr2) and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the gustatory neurons of C. elegans.\nExpression of Sstr2 and CCR5 in gustatory neurons allow C. elegans to specifically detect and respond to somatostatin and MIP-1alpha respectively in a robust avoidance assay. We demonstrate that mammalian heterologous GPCRs can signal via different endogenous Galpha subunits in C. elegans, depending on which cells it is expressed in. Furthermore, pre-exposure of GPCR transgenic animals to its ligand leads to receptor desensitisation and behavioural adaptation to subsequent ligand exposure, providing further evidence of integration of the mammalian GPCRs into the C. elegans sensory signalling machinery.

The potential for hypertrophy regression could therefore be related to the preoperative risk profile.\nNinety-one consecutive patients with AS had a \"project\" Doppler-echo and radionuclide ventriculography in addition to the standard investigation programme prior to AVR with a disc valve (19-29mm, n=82), a caged ball valve (26-29mm, n=8), or a stented porcine valve (26mm, n=1); 49 (group A) were selected for a serial follow-up study while 42 served as controls (group B). Forty-two group A patients took part in a 1.5-year examination while 47 (26 group A, 21 group B) patients were studied at 10 years.\nGroups A and B were comparable as regards all pre- and intra-operative data including left ventricular mass index (LVMi). A previously developed preoperative prognostic index (PI) separated the patients into groups with low (n=23), intermediary (n=19) and high risk (n=49) with 10-year survivals of 87%, 58% and 43% (P<0.01). LVMi dropped from 202+\/-58g\/m(2)preoperatively to 152+\/-45g\/m(2)(P<0.0001) at 1.5 years, and 139+\/-40g\/m(2)(P<0.0001) at 10 years (three and six patients, respectively, with paravalvular leak or mitral regurgitation excluded). PI correlated with preoperative (r=0.51, P<0.001), 1.5-year (r=0.46, P<0.01), and 10-year LVMi (r=0.41, P<0.01). Also preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction correlated with the three LVMi measurements. Patients with systemic hypertension had higher LVMi at 1.5 years (193+\/-42, n=6 vs 144+\/-42, n=33, P<0.05) and 10 years (175+\/-39, n=12 vs 124+\/-31g\/m(2), n=29, P<0.001).

Fetal programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has been suggested as a possible explanation. Fetal glucocorticoid (GC) overexposure has effects that suggest a role of GCs in this programming. The effects of GCs are mediated through the GC receptor (GR or NR3C1). Several functional polymorphisms have been described, which are associated with relative GC resistance or hypersensitivity. Our aim is to compare frequencies of GR haplotypes, characterized by the R23K, N363S, Bcl1, or 9\u03b2 polymorphisms, in subjects born small for gestational age (SGA) and associate birth anthropometry data, response to GH treatment, blood pressure, glucose and insulin concentrations, and body composition with these haplotypes.\nIn total, 418 SGA subjects and 697 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Methods Anthropometry data were obtained, as well as blood samples to determine fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were used to measure the amount of fat and lean mass.\nNo differences were found between GR haplotype frequencies in SGA children compared with healthy controls. No associations were found between GR haplotypes and birth length and birth weight, growth response during GH treatment, blood pressure, glucose and insulin concentrations, and body composition."},{"passage":"The worldwide increase in end-stage renal disease has been alleged to be associated with insulin resistance-related conditions. Insulin resistance and the concomitant compensatory hyperinsulinaemia may accelerate age-related decline in renal function through inducing glomerular hyperfiltration, even in non-diabetic subjects. This population-based study is the first to investigate whether fasting insulin concentrations modify the relationship between age and renal function in a general non-diabetic population.\nFasting insulin was measured in 3432 subjects, representing the general population. Cross-sectional analyses of the association between age, renal function and its modification by insulin were performed by means of linear regression. Renal function was assessed as 24-h creatinine clearance (CrCl) and 24-h urinary albumine excretion (UAE).\nAge was 48 +\/- 12 (range: 28-75) years, 44% were male, CrCl was 100 +\/- 26 ml\/min and UAE was 7.0 (5.4-10.7)] mg\/24 h. The results confirmed a parabolic relation between age and renal function. Fasting insulin modified these parabolic relationships of age with CrCl and UAE (P < 0.001 for both interaction terms), in such a way that hyperinsulinaemia is associated with a stronger inverse parabolic relation between age and CrCl, and stronger positive parabolic relation between age and UAE at an older age than lower insulin concentrations."},{"passage":"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors significantly improve survival in patients with atherosclerosis. Although ACE inhibitors reduce local angiotensin II (AngII) formation, serine proteases form AngII to an enormous amount independently from ACE. Therefore, our study concentrates on the effect of the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat on chemokine release, AngII receptor (ATR) expression, and NF-kappaB activity in monocytes stimulated with AngII.\nAngII-induced upregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1 protein and RNA in monocytes was inhibited by the AT1R-blocker losartan, but not by the AT2R-blocker PD 123.319. Ramiprilat dose-dependently suppressed AngII-induced upregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1. The suppressive effect of ramiprilat on AngII-induced chemokine production and release was in part caused by downregulation of NF-kappaB, but more by a selective and highly significant reduced expression of AT1 receptors as shown in monocytes and endothelial cells."},{"passage":"The SPINK1 mutation N34S is associated to chronic pancreatitis of idiopathic, alcoholic and tropic origin.

SYK has also been involved in the signaling of immunoreceptors, cytokine receptors, and integrins. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of SYK attenuates the inflammatory process underlying atherosclerosis and reduces plaque development.\nLow-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice consuming a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with 2 doses of the orally available SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for 16 weeks showed a dose-dependent reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size by up to 59\u00b16% compared with the respective controls. Lesions of fostamatinib-treated animals contained fewer macrophages but more smooth muscle cells and collagen-characteristics associated with more stable plaques in humans. Mechanistically, fostamatinib attenuated adhesion and migration of inflammatory cells and limited macrophage survival. Furthermore, fostamatinib normalized high-cholesterol diet -induced monocytosis and inflammatory gene expression."},{"passage":"In a previous study we have demonstrated significant reduction of intimal hyperplasia after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of p53 protein to the injured rat carotid artery. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether apoptosis is one of the mechanisms responsible for this reduction.

Genetically modified adenovirus encoding for wild-type p53 protein (AdWTp53) was applied at 8 x 10(10) plaque-forming units\/mL. Control rats received either adenovirus null at the same concentration or balloon injury alone. Arteries were harvested at 24 and 48 hours after the procedure. Apoptosis was detected in tissue sections by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Specimens were graded either negative or positive less than 10%, 10% to 20%, 20% to 30%, or greater than 30% according to the number of apoptotic cells in the medial or intimal layer per high power field. Specimens were also subjected to DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy.\nWith the TUNEL assay no apoptosis was visualized at 24 and 48 hours in the controls (n = 5 in each group), whereas in the AdWTp53 groups (n = 5 in each) all specimens presented apoptosis (P < .05, AdWTp53 vs controls). The average grade of apoptotic cells detected in the medial layer in the AdWTp53 groups was less than 10% to 20% at 24 hours and 20% to 30% at 48 hours.

Non-malignant-appearing nodes may be an indicator of early malignancy in the thyroid. We hypothesize that there is an increased prediction of thyroid cancer when benign-appearing enlarged CLN (ECLN) > 1 cm in any dimension are present during an US evaluation of thyroid nodules.\nA review of 269 consecutive patients' charts sent for thyroid nodule assessment that underwent thyroidectomy was conducted to compare ECLN, with the presence of thyroid cancer during an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid nodule. Surgical excision pathology confirmed all abnormal cytology reports.\nFrom the final 265 charts reviewed, 213 had benign thyroid pathology and 52 had thyroid cancer. Sex, number, and size of the biggest thyroid nodule were not different between groups. Patients with cancer were on average 10 years younger and had higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values (p < 0.003) as well as a 10-fold increase in enlarged non-malignant-appearing lymph nodes than their peers without cancer. The presence of ECLN had an 82% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and a 68% positive predictive value for thyroid cancer. There was also an 80% negative predictive value when enlarged lymph nodes were not present. In 8 of the 37 (21.6%) patients with malignancy and ECLN, the primary dominant thyroid nodule was negative on cytologic evaluation, but malignancies were confirmed on surgical specimen, in contralateral nodules on the same side as the ECLN. These nodules were mostly subcentimeric, ranging from 0.2 to 1.14 cm and were not biopsied due to their inconspicuous appearance. After multiple logistic regression analysis, enlarged lymph nodes had a 53.8 odds ratio for cancer (20.49-141.33, p < 0.01)."},{"passage":"Patients with abdominal pain often return multiple times despite no definitive diagnosis.

Levels of OPN have been shown to be significantly correlated with interleukin-17 (IL-17) production and expression of Th17 cells in the synovial fluid of RA patients. Here, we investigated the role of OPN in monocyte migration, IL-17 production and osteoblasts.\nOPN and IL-17 expression profiles in osteoarthritis (OA) and RA synovial fluid were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of the microRNA, miR-129-3p, in osteoblasts was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunoreactive proteins were spotted by Western blotting. We used the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model to investigate the role of OPN in monocyte migration during RA.\nOPN and IL-17 expression were higher in RA synovial fluid as compared to OA samples. We also found that OPN promotes IL-17 expression in osteoblasts and thereby enhances monocyte migration via the Syk\/PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway. miR-129-3p expression was found to be negatively regulated by OPN via the Syk\/PI3K\/Akt signal cascade. In contrast, lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNA inhibited OPN expression and ameliorated articular swelling, cartilage erosion and monocyte infiltration in the ankle joints of CIA mice."},{"passage":"Prions, composed of a misfolded protein designated PrP(Sc), are infectious agents causing fatal neurodegenerative diseases. We have shown previously that, following induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, prion-infected mice succumb to disease significantly earlier than controls, concomitant with the deposition of PrP(Sc) aggregates in inflamed white matter areas. In the present work, we asked whether prion disease acceleration by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis results from infiltration of viable prion-infected immune cells into the central nervous system.\nC57Bl\/6 J mice underwent intraperitoneal inoculation with scrapie brain homogenates and were later induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by inoculation of MOG(35-55) in complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented with pertussis toxin. Spleen and lymph node cells from the co-induced animals were reactivated and subsequently injected into na\u00efve mice as viable cells or as cell homogenates. Control groups were infected with viable and homogenized scrapie immune cells only with complete Freund's adjuvant. Prion disease incubation times as well as levels and sites of PrP(Sc) deposition were next evaluated.\nWe first show that acceleration of prion disease by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis requires the presence of high levels of spleen PrP(Sc). Next, we present evidence that mice infected with activated prion-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis viable cells succumb to prion disease considerably faster than do mice infected with equivalent cell extracts or other controls, concomitant with the deposition of PrP(Sc) aggregates in white matter areas in brains and spinal cords."},{"passage":"In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe G1\/S cell-cycle regulated transcription depends upon MBF. A negative feedback loop involving Nrm1p and Yox1p bound to MBF leads to transcriptional repression as cells exit G1 phase. However, activation of the DNA replication checkpoint response during S phase results in persistent expression of MBF-dependent genes.\nThis report shows that Yox1p binding to MBF is Nrm1-dependent and that Yox1p and Nrm1p require each other to bind and repress MBF targets. In response to DNA replication stress both Yox1p and Nrm1p dissociate from MBF at promoters leading to de-repression of MBF targets. Inactivation of Yox1p is an essential part of the checkpoint response. Cds1p (human Chk2p) checkpoint protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Yox1p promotes its dissociation from the MBF transcription factor. We establish that phosphorylation of Yox1p at Ser114, Thr115 is required for maximal checkpoint-dependent activation of the G1\/S cell-cycle transcriptional program."},{"passage":"Children and adolescents with femoral fractures are almost always admitted to hospital. They invariably start their hospital experience in the Emergency Department, often requiring transfer to a specialist children's hospital. They require analgesia or anaesthesia so that radiographs can be obtained and for management of their fractures. The initial care process involves from two to six transfers from stretcher to stretcher\/imaging\/operating-suite table or hospital bed within the first few hours, so prompt pain relief is essential. Systemic analgesia can be provided orally or parenterally. Alternatively, a nerve block may be used where local anaesthetic is injected around a nerve to block sensation or freeze the involved area.\nTo assess the effects (benefits and harms) of femoral nerve block (FNB) or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for initial pain management of children with fractures of the femur (thigh bone) in the pre-hospital or in-hospital emergency setting, with or without systemic analgesia.\nWe searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (11 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012 Issue 12), MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 01), Google Scholar (31 January 2013) and trial registries (31 January 2013). We handsearched recent issues of specialist journals and references of relevant articles.\nRandomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of FNB or FICB\u00a0for initial pain management compared with systemic opiates in children (aged under 18 years) with fractures of the femur receiving pre-hospital or in hospital emergency care. Primary outcomes included failure of analgesia at 30 minutes, pain levels during procedures and transfers (e.g. to a stretcher or hospital ward) for up to eight hours, and adverse effects.\nTwo review authors independently extracted data using a pre-piloted form. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for the included study and assessed quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach; i.e. as very low, low, moderate or high. Meta-analysis of results was not possible as we found only one trial that could be included in the review.\nWe included one randomised trial of 55 children aged between 16 months to 15 years. It compared anatomically-guided FICB versus systemic analgesia with intravenous morphine sulphate. The small sample size and the high risk of bias relating to lack of blinding resulted in a low quality rating for all outcomes.Overall, the trial provided low quality evidence for better pain management in the FICB group. Fewer children in the FICB group had analgesia failure at 30 minutes than in the morphine group (2\/26 (8%) versus 8\/28 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.20; P value 0.09). The trial did not report on pain during procedures or transfers, or application of analgesia. The trial provided low quality evidence that FICB has a better safety profile than morphine, with only four (15%) reports of redness and pain at the injection site, and no reports of the type of adverse effects of systematic analgesia that occurred in the morphine group, such as respiratory depression (six cases (21%)) and vomiting (four cases (14%)). No long-term adverse events were reported for either intervention. Clinically significant pain relief was achieved in both groups at five minutes; with limited evidence of greater initial pain relief in the FICB group. Based on an inspection of graphically-presented data, at least 46% (12\/26) of children in the FICB group had no supplementary medication (mainly analgesia) for the six hours of the study, while only 5% (1 or 2\/28) of children in the intravenous morphine group went without additional analgesia. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether child or parental satisfaction with the method of analgesia favoured either method.

We hypothesised that inhibition of PIM kinase activity with SGI-1776, a novel small molecule inhibitor of PIM kinase activity, would reduce the viability of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells and enhance the activity of sunitinib.\nImmunoblotting, qRT-PCR, and gene expression arrays were carried out to identify genes modulated by SGI-1776 treatment. The anticancer activity of SGI-1776 and sunitinib was determined by viability and apoptosis assays and in tumour xenografts in vivo.\nTreatment with SGI-1776 led to a decrease in phosphorylated and total c-Myc levels, which resulted in the modulation of c-Myc target genes. SGI-1776 in combination with sunitinib induced a further reduction in c-Myc levels, which was associated with enhanced anticancer activity. siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc demonstrated that its expression has a key role in regulating the sensitivity to the combination of SGI-1776 and sunitinib.

Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells were considered as osteoclasts, and the resorption area was determined by incubating the cells on dentine discs. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a direct enzyme immunoassay. Signaling pathways were investigated using western blot and RT-PCR. Recombinant afamin was administered exogenously to bone cell cultures.\nAfamin stimulated both osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone resorption. Consistently, the expressions of osteoclast differentiation markers were significantly increased by afamin.

For IL-5 gene expression, we hypothesized that the mode of T-cell activation also determines the ultimate effect of simultaneous PKA activation.\nThe objective of this study was the examination of IL-5 gene expression in healthy T cells activated with various mitogenic stimuli after simultaneous activation of PKA by dibutyryl-cAMP or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).\nIL-5 mRNA was measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Northern analysis. IL-5 protein was measured by ELISA. Transcriptional mechanisms involved in IL-5 gene expression were determined by nuclear run-on experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Posttranscriptional mechanisms were determined by actinomycin D chase studies.\nAnti-CD2-, anti-CD3-, and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-induced IL-5 mRNA were completely inhibited by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10[-3] mol\/L) and PGE2 (10[-5] mol\/L), whereas concanavalin A-induced IL-5 mRNA was partially reduced. The effect of PGE2 was accomplished at the transcriptional level, probably as the result of inhibition of DNA binding of nuclear factor-kappaB. Anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-induced IL-5 protein (504 +\/- 56 pg\/ml) was significantly reduced by PGE2 (122 +\/- 42 pg\/ml, p < 0.001).

Forty papular and\/or macular lesions harbored HPV DNA, 28 (35%) of them positive with in situ hybridization and the other 12 (15%) positive with polymerase chain reaction. Morphologic signs attributed to HPV infection were found in HPV-positive and HPV-negative penile lesions, as well as in normal epithelium. In papular and macular lesions, the only criterion associated with HPV DNA positivity was neoplastic changes, which was present in 16 (40%) HPV DNA-positive specimens, compared to 4 (10%) HPV DNA-negative specimens (P < 0.01).

In this study, we investigated the impact of antibiotics and AIEC challenge on murine intestinal dysbiosis and neutrophil extracellular trap activation, which is a critical component of the neutrophil antimicrobial repertoire.\nMale C57BL\/6 mice were administered vancomycin and gentamicin (once daily, 3 days), and subsequently challenged with AIEC strain LF82 (once daily, 2 days). Perturbation of the gut microbiota was monitored using a combination of molecular and phylogenetic analyses. The impact of commensal and dysbiotic gut bacterial communities on neutrophil extracellular trap mobilization and intestinal redox balance was also quantified.\nExposure of neutrophils to murine commensal gut microbial communities activated neutrophil extracellular trap formation. The capacity of neutrophils to cast these web-like structures was exacerbated following antibiotic and AIEC-associated intestinal dysbiosis, highlighting the possible overgrowth of immune-activating intestinal pathobionts. Intestinal dysbiosis was associated with an elevated capacity of the cultivated gut bacteria to produce reactive oxygen species in vitro, and increased colonic oxidative stress in vivo."},{"passage":"Treatment of breast cancer patients with antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitor(s) or Herceptin have shown significant success in steroid receptor positive or Her-2+ breast cancers respectively.

In this report we evaluated efficacy and mechanism of action of Deguelin in triple negative breast cancer cell lines.\nIn vitro, Deguelin in a dose and time dependent manner inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-549 and BT-20 cells. Deguelin (2 or 4 mg\/kg body weight), when injected intraperitoneally, reduced the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 cells transplanted subcutaneously in athymic mice. Moreover it was nontoxic as evident from daily observations on mobility, food and water consumption and comparison of bodyweight and other visceral organ weights with those in control animals at the termination of the study.
