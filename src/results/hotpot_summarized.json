This law restricts the ingredients that can be used in beer production. Specifically, the Reinheitsgebot originally allowed only water, barley, and hops as the ingredients for beer. While modern interpretations may have expanded the list of allowed ingredients slightly, compliance with the Reinheitsgebot still fundamentally involves adhering to strict ingredient standards.\n\nFrom the text, we know that the Reinheitsgebot is a series of regulations that limit beer ingredients. Therefore, in order to comply with these regulations, the Hacker-Pschorr Brewery must limit its beer production to specified ingredients, primarily maintaining the core ingredients allowed under the law. \n\nFinal Answer: The Hacker-Pschorr Brewery must limit its beer production to ingredients specified by the Reinheitsgebot, primarily water, barley, and hops.",

We start with the first sentence that states Lullwater Estate was built for Lucy Beall Candler Owens Heinz, who is the daughter of Coca-Cola co-founder Asa Griggs Candler. Importantly, the text does not mention that she is the daughter of the 41st Mayor of Atlanta, Robert Foster Maddox. \n\n2. The next part of the text confirms that Lullwater Estate is also known as Rainbow Terrace and is located in the Druid Hills Historic District.\n\n3. We learn that Robert Foster Maddox served as the 41st Mayor of Atlanta from 1923 to 1927, but there is no familial connection implied between him and Lucy Beall Candler Owens Heinz.\n\n4.

    "answer": "The text provides information specifically about Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport, which handled 294,000 passengers in 2012. However, it does not specify the number of passengers handled by the airline operating there (Air North) specifically. The information just indicates that the airport serves as a base for Air North, which operates flights in various regions.\n\nSince the question is specifically about the number of passengers that the airline in Whitehorse, Yukon handled in 2012, and the text does not provide this number directly for Air North, the answer remains related to the airport\u2019s overall traffic.\n\nBased on the available information, we focus on the figures provided for the airport rather than the specific airline's traffic. Therefore, the answer is tied to the passenger numbers for the airport itself.\n\nFinal Answer: 294,000 passengers (for the airport, not the airline specifically).",
